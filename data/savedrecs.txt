   detecting malicious web scraping behavior. We use a real dataset of
   Apache HTTP Access logs for an e-commerce application provided by
   Amadeus, a large multinational IT provider for the global travel and
   tourism industry. Two tools have been used to detect scraping activities
   based on the HTTP requests: a commercial tool, and an in-house tool
   called Arcane. Preliminary results suggest there is considerable
   diversity in alerting behavior of these tools.

   concentrated on a specific sector. The purpose of this study is to
   compare two sectors wherein there are grounds to hypothesise that
   lifestyle reasons play a key role for occupational choice.
   Design/methodology/approach Arguing that the potential for qualitative
   web scraping is still underused, the hypothesis is tested through
   qualitative web scraping for occupational choices. Findings It is shown
   that incomes for farmers are both documented in a better way and higher
   than in arts. The central roles played by farmers in the provision of
   basic needs and in powerful value chains are possible reasons for this
   difference. As a common factor between the sectors, two-thirds of both
   farmers and artists choose their profession for reasons of
   self-realisation or societal motives. Originality/value This study is
   the first to show both common grounds and differences in occupational
   choices of two different sectors.

AB The main goal of this research note is to educate business researchers
   on how to automatically scrape financial data from the World Wide Web
   using the R programming language. This paper is organized into the
   following main parts. The first part provides a conceptual overview of
   the web scraping process. The second part educates the reader about the
   Rvest package-a popular tool for browsing and downloading web data in R.
   The third part educates the reader about the main functions of the XBRL
   package. The XBRL package was developed specifically for working with
   financial data distributed using the XBRL format in the R environment.
   The fourth part of this paper presents an example of a relatively
   complex web scraping task implemented using the R language. This complex
   web scraping task involves using both the Rvest and XBRL packages for
   the purposes of retrieving, preprocessing, and organizing financial and
   nonfinancial data related to a company from various sources and using
   different data forms. The paper ends with some concluding remarks on how
   the web scraping approach presented in this paper can be useful in other
   research projects involving financial and nonfinancial data.

AB In the current competitive market, offering a relatively cheaper price
   for the commodity plays an important role in obtaining a greater share
   of the market for a corporate entity as it encourages more customers to
   purchase from its product. Convenience stores are becoming indispensable
   for the Japanese society, there are presently 54,008 retail stores
   throughout Japan and their number continues to increase. The reasons
   behind such popularity are convenient locations, attractive products and
   long trading hours. Their price, however, are more expensive than
   regular supermarkets and groceries stores mainly due to their numerous
   overhead cost, the major of which is their requirement for refurbishment
   of goods several times per day. In this study, a practical approach that
   utilizes computer techniques to find an optimal vehicle routing scheme
   for goods and service delivery to multiple convenience stores is
   investigated. Although many scholars have already investigated the
   location problem of supply chain facilities and centers under different
   conditions, this study takes a programming approach using Web Scraping
   and Excel VBA and hope to turn it into a cheap but powerful Excel Add-in
   module or real-time navigation function. A mathematical 'network flow
   model' is initially developed to examine the problem. Geographical data
   of convenience stores, their associated warehouses, garbage dumpsites
   and gas stations are subsequently retrieved through programming with the
   'web scraping' technique. A computer program that utilizes Google API
   service is then developed to solve the optimal networking problem.
   Validity of obtained results is also examined by other known method to
   justify its optimality and fast performance.

AB With the increasing relevance and availability of on-line prices that we
   see today, it is natural to ask whether the prediction of the consumer
   price index (CPI), or related statistics, may usefully be computed more
   frequently than existing monthly schedules allow for. The simple answer
   is 'yes', but there are challenges to be overcome first. A key
   challenge, addressed by our work, is that web-scraped price data are
   extremely messy and it is not obvious, a priori, how to reconcile them
   with standard CPI statistics. Our research focuses on average prices and
   disaggregated CPI at the level of product categories (lager, potatoes,
   etc.) and develops a new model that describes the joint time evolution
   of latent daily log-inflation rates driving prices seen on the Internet
   and prices recorded in official surveys, with the model adapting to
   various product categories. Our model reveals the differing levels of
   dynamic behaviour across product category and, correspondingly,
   differing levels of predictability. Our methodology enables good
   prediction of product-category-specific CPI immediately before their
   release. In due course, with increasingly complete web-scraped data,
   combined with the best survey data, the prospect of more frequent
   intermonth aggregated CPI prediction is an achievable goal.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss web scraping as a
   method for extracting large amounts of data from online sources. The
   author wants to raise awareness of the method's potential in the field
   of food price research, hoping to enable fellow researchers to apply
   this method.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author explains the technical
   procedure of web scraping, reviews the existing literature, and
   identifies areas of application and limitations for food price research.
   Findings - The author finds that web scraping is a promising method to
   collect customised, high-frequency data in real time, overcoming several
   limitations of currently used food price data sources. With today's
   applications mostly focussing on (online) consumer prices, the scope of
   applications for web scraping broadens as more and more price data are
   published online.
   Research limitations/implications - To better deal with the technical
   and legal challenges of web scraping and to exploit its scalability,
   joint data collection projects in the field of agricultural and food
   economics should be considered.
   Originality/value - In agricultural and food economics, web scraping as
   a data collection technique has received little attention. This is one
   of the first articles to address this topic with particular focus on
   food price analysis.

   that is pro-active in finding individuals who may be at risk. The paper
   outlines the relationship between the content of text, in this instance
   located in electronic social spaces, and the underlying mental health of
   the writer. It is suggested that web scrapers could be utilized as a
   tool to trawl blogs to identify text patterns that may indicate that the
   writer may benefit from counseling support services. The paper only
   considers a possible technical approach and does not examine the
   substantial ethical issues that would arise from the implementation of
   such an approach in practice. The ethical aspects will be explored in a

AB Promoting the circularity of business practices and product offerings is
   a pivotal process in increasing the value of circular products, coming
   with a still underestimated effect on market response and, thus, firm
   performance. This study investigates the communication intensity of
   companies adopting circular economy (CE) practices, here with the aim of
   assessing the extent to which promoting circularity in-creases their
   economic performance (measured as return on assetsdROA), disentangling
   this effect for the different quantiles of the ROA distribution.
   Employing a unique web-scraped dataset of companies' websites, we
   captured and analyzed the online promotional efforts of a sample of
   Italian manufacturing companies engaged in CE practices. Our results
   show that small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that fall into the
   lower-mediumeperforming range might benefit from intensively signaling
   their circularity on their website. Theoretical and managerial
   implications are put forward.

AB 'Factoryless manufacturing' describes the strategic decision by
   businesses to contract out part or all of their production, sometimes
   overseas. Although it has become widespread in some sectors of
   manufacturing, the phenomenon is not captured by existing economic
   statistics. This implies that the decline of manufacturing, often a
   focus of policy, may be overstated, while trade statistics fail to
   reflect globalized production. We present web-scraped evidence on the
   extent of factoryless manufacturing in the UK, finding that firms in
   sectors such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals are much more likely to
   use contract manufacturing, whereas in the US it is more prevalent
   within electronics. We also present case studies highlighting that firms
   can both use and provide contract manufacturing services. The
   limitations of the statistics imply that governments may believe their
   manufacturing sectors to be smaller than is the case and at the same
   time be unaware of the globalized character of much of that
   manufacturing production, adversely affecting their economic policies.

   retailers set their prices of a commodity that is in short supply. We
   show that when customer reservation value is relatively high and
   retailers are differentiated in fill rate, both retailers choose the

AB Water scarcity has been a big issue for agriculture. This proposed idea
   is beneficial to the farmers to irrigate the farms efficiently using an
   automated irrigation system based on soil temperature, moisture and pH.
   Respective sensors are used to find the soil water content level and
   based on this microcontroller drives the servo motor and pump.
   Irrigation status is updated to the database using PC. This technique
   works by installing sensors in the field to monitor the soil
   temperature, moisture and type of soil, which transmits the data to the
   microcontroller for estimation of accurate quantity of water as per the
   requirements. The collected data is updated from time to time to the
   server and can be accessed via an Android app. The subsequent watering
   of plants can be controlled using the aforementioned app. Depending upon
   the type of soil and crop, the fertilizers arc suggested by applying
   Naive Bayes algorithm on the database. The estimated amount of rain is
   predicted using weather forecasting using Web scraper and the crops are
   watered accordingly, i.e., is a heavy rainfall is predicted then the
   system will automatically reduce the water supplied to the crops.

AB The success of the Silk Road has prompted the growth of many Dark Web
   marketplaces. This exponential growth has provided criminal enterprises
   with new outlets to sell illicit items. Thus, the Dark Web has generated
   great interest from academics and governments who have sought to unveil
   the identities of participants in these highly lucrative, yet illegal,
   marketplaces. Traditional Web scraping methodologies and investigative
   techniques have proven to be inept at unmasking these marketplace
   participants. This research provides an analytical framework for
   automating Dark Web scraping and analysis with free tools found on the
   World Wide Web. Using a case study marketplace, we successfully tested a
   Web crawler, developed using AppleScript, to retrieve the account
   information for thousands of vendors and their respective marketplace
   listings. This paper clearly details why AppleScript was the most viable
   and efficient method for scraping Dark Web marketplaces. The results
   from our case study validate the efficacy of our proposed analytical
   framework, which has relevance for academics studying this growing
   phenomenon and for investigators examining criminal activity on the Dark
   Web.

AB Understanding the sensory attributes that explain the typicity of
   Australian Cabernet Sauvignon wines is essential for increasing value
   and growth of Australia's reputation as a fine wine producer. Content
   analysis of 2598 web-based wine reviews from well-known wine writers,
   including tasting notes and scores, was used to gather information about
   the regional profiles of Australian Cabernet Sauvignon wines and to
   create selection criteria for further wine studies. In addition, a wine
   expert panel evaluated 84 commercial Cabernet Sauvignon wines from
   Coonawarra, Margaret River, Yarra Valley and Bordeaux, using freely
   chosen descriptions and overall quality scores. Using content analysis
   software, a sensory lexicon of descriptor categories was built and
   frequencies of each category for each region were computed. Distinction
   between the sensory profiles of the regions was achieved by
   correspondence analysis (CA) using online review and expert panellist
   data. Wine quality scores obtained from reviews and experts were
   converted into Australian wine show medal categories. CA of assigned
   medal and descriptor frequencies revealed the sensory attributes that
   appeared to drive medal-winning wines. Multiple factor analysis of
   frequencies from the reviews and expert panellists indicated agreement
   about descriptors that were associated with wines of low and high
   quality, with greater alignment at the lower end of the wine quality
   assessment scale.

AB As consumers increasingly research and purchase hospitality and travel
   services online, new research opportunities have become available to
   hospitality academics. There is a growing interest in understanding the
   online travel marketplace among hospitality researchers. Although many
   researchers have attempted to better understand the online travel market
   through the use of analytical models, experiments, or survey collection,
   these studies often fail to capture the full complexity of the market.
   Academics often rely upon survey data or experiments owing to their ease
   of collection or potentially to the difficulty in assembling online
   data. In this study, we hope to equip hospitality researchers with the
   tools and methods to augment their traditional data sources with the
   readily available data that consumers use to make their travel choices.
   In this article, we provide a guideline (and Python code) for how to
   best collect/scrape publicly available online hotel data. We focus on
   the collection of online data across numerous platforms, including
   online travel agents, review sites, and hotel brand sites. We outline
   some exciting possibilities regarding how these data sources might be
   utilized, as well as discuss some of the caveats that have to be
   considered when analyzing online data.

AB Purpose This study aims to propose a data-driven approach, based on
   open-source tools, that makes it possible to understand customer
   satisfaction of the accommodation offer of a whole country.
   Design/methodology/approach The method starts by extracting information
   from all hotels of Portugal available at TripAdvisor through Web
   scraping. Then, a support vector machine is adopted for modeling the
   TripAdvisor score, which is considered a proxy of customer satisfaction.
   Finally, knowledge extraction from the model is achieved using
   sensitivity analysis to unveil the influence of features on the score.
   Findings The model of the TripAdvisor score achieved a mean absolute
   percentage error of around 5 per cent, proving the value of modeling the
   extracted data. The number of rooms of the unit and the minimum price
   are the two most relevant features, showing that customers appreciate
   smaller and more expensive units, whereas the location of the hotel does
   not hold significant relevance.
   Originality/value National tourist offices can use the proposed approach
   to understand what drives tourists' satisfaction, helping to shape a
   country's strategy. For example, licensing new hotels may take into
   account the unit size and other characteristics that make it more
   attractive to tourists. Furthermore, the procedure can be replicated at
   any time and in any country, making it a valuable tool for data-driven
   decision support on a national scale.

   delivery is not primarily about speed but that there are four distinct
   experiential factors to be considered for SMDs. Fast food delivery
   services are associated both with the actual product (i.e. product
   issues and brand satisfaction) and with the augmented product (payment
   process and service handling). Originality/value Findings demonstrate
   the relevance of SMDs in omnichannel food retail environments and guide

AB The unrivaled growth in e-commerce of animals and plants presents an
   unprecedented opportunity to monitor wildlife trade to inform
   conservation, biosecurity, and law enforcement. Using the internet to
   quantify the scale of the wildlife trade (volume and frequency) is a
   relatively recent and rapidly developing approach that lacks an
   accessible framework for locating relevant websites and collecting data.
   We produced an accessible guide for internet-based wildlife trade
   surveillance. We detailed a repeatable method involving a systematic
   internet search, with search engines, to locate relevant websites and
   content. For data collection, we highlight web-scraping technology as an
   efficient way to collect data in an automated fashion at regularly timed
   intervals. Our guide is applicable to the multitude of trade-based
   contexts because researchers can tailor search keywords for specific
   taxa or derived products and locations of interest. We provide
   information for working with the diversity of websites used in wildlife
   trade. For example, to locate relevant content on social media (e.g.,
   posts or groups), each social media platform should be examined
   individually via the site's internal search engine. A key advantage of
   using the internet to study wildlife trade is the relative ease of
   access to an increasing amount of trade-related data. However, not all
   wildlife trade occurs online and it may occur on unobservable sections
   of the internet.

AB Websites serve content both through Web Services as well as through
   user-viewable webpages. While the consumers of web-services are
   typically 'machines', webpages are meant for human users. It is highly
   desirable (for reasons of security, revenue, ownership, availability
   etc.) for service providers that content that will undergo further
   processing be fetched in a prescribed fashion, preferably through a
   supplied Web Services. In fact, monetization of partnerships within a
   services ecosystem normally means that website data translate into
   valuable revenue. Unfortunately, it is quite commonplace for arbitrary
   developers to extract or leverage information from websites without
   asking for permission and or negotiating a revenue sharing agreement.
   This may translate to significant lost income for content providers.
   Even in cases where website owners are happy to share the data, they may
   want users to adopt dedicated Web Service APIs (and associated
   API-servers) rather than putting a load on their revenue-generating
   websites. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism that disables
   automated web scraping agents, thus forcing clients to conform to the
   provided Web Services.

AB The advances in technology are eliminating the demand for certain

   teachers, and students have to collaboratively work together to
   restructure their departments, course offerings, and course contents.
   Failure to realize the aforementioned initiatives may lead to a loss of
   quality and competitiveness. This study proposes a decision support
   system capable of maintaining the quality and competitiveness of the
   departments and the course offerings. The proposed system consists of
   three stages. The first stage is the data collection stage. At this
   stage, data are collected from the internet using web scraping methods.
   In the second stage, the collected data are turned into meaningful and
   processable information by natural language processing methods. In the
   third stage, the alternatives are ranked using multi-criteria
   decision-making methods. The proposed decision support system provides
   useful information to several educational stakeholders. First,
   universities are informed on which departments to create or close as
   well as the relevant course offerings. Second, information are provided
   to the teachers to create new courses or shape the course contents.
   Finally, students are better informed on how to go about choosing the
   universities, departments, courses, or career paths to pursue. The
   applicability and reliability of the proposed decision support system
   were experimentally proven through the use of computer
   engineering-related job postings and course contents of the universities
   in Turkey.

AB Real estate appraisal is necessary for a range of endeavours, including
   property insurance, investment analysis, taxation and sales listing.
   Along with prospective buyers and sellers, estimating the prices of real
   estates can benefit investors as well. This paper makes a comparative
   analysis of four ensemble methods, viz. Bootstrap Aggregating, Random
   Forest, Gradient Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting for real estate
   appraisal. The comparison is based on estimating real estate prices in
   Mumbai. The data for this study was obtained by web scraping from the
   real estate website 99acres. The collected data was utilized for
   training and testing the above-mentioned ensemble models and comparing
   their performances. Grid search was used for fine-tuning the
   hyperparameters of the learning models. Also, preprocessing techniques
   such as dimensionality reduction and one-hot encoding were used for
   improving the accuracy of the models. Analysis of the results shows that
   using ensemble methods for estimating real estate prices is a realistic
   prospect.

AB We explore pilot web-based methods to probe the strategies followed by
   new small and medium-sized technology-based firms as they seek to
   commercialize emerging technologies. Tracking and understanding the
   behavior of such early commercial entrants is not straightforward
   because smaller firms with limited resources do not always widely engage
   in readily visible and accessible activities such as publishing and
   patenting. However, many new firms, even if small, present information
   about themselves that is available online. Focusing on the early
   commercialization of novel graphene technologies, we introduce a "web
   scraping" approach to systematically capture information contained in
   the online web pages of a sample of small and medium-sized high
   technology graphene firms in the US, UK, and China. We analyze this
   information and devise measures that gauge how firm specialization in
   the target technology impacts overall market orientation. Three groups
   of graphene enterprises are identified which vary by their focus on
   product development, materials development, and integration into
   existing product portfolios. Country-level factors are important in
   understanding these early diverging commercial approaches in the nascent
   graphene market. We consider management and policy implications of our
   findings, and discuss the value, including strengths and weaknesses, of
   web scraping as an additional information source on enterprise
   strategies in emerging technologies.

AB Public policies have encouraged the proliferation of technology
   platforms that support the transition towards sustainable agriculture
   and the development of innovations in the food system. Provided the
   difficulty associated with assessing the outputs and outcomes of
   technology platforms, this work proposes a practical assessment method
   based on the retrieval and analysis of online documents related to the
   technology platforms. Concretely, the method consists of applying web
   scraping techniques to retrieve documents related to a technology
   platform from the Internet and then applying web data-mining techniques
   to automatically classify these documents into the functions that the
   platform should fulfill, which are described from the viewpoint of
   co-evolution of innovation. Data are automatically processed to obtain a
   variety of metrics, which are applied to measure the impact of European
   Technology Platforms (ETPs) on promoting an organic food paradigm. This
   method provides time-series data that helps to follow the evolution of
   the different functions of the platform and to describe its lifecycle.
   It has been applied to one platform taken as a case study, TP Organics,
   which represents a key platform for stakeholders that promote organic
   farming and agroecology as core components of an ambitious program for
   sustainable agriculture. The obtained online-based measures have been
   proven to assess the global evolution of the platform, its dissemination
   through the European Union (EU) Member States, and the evolution of the
   different functions expected to be fulfilled by it regarding the
   diffusion and promotion of innovations in organic agriculture.

   what the underlying channels are. To address our questions, we
   web-scraped corporate social responsibility (CSR) news to form a sample
   of publicly traded non-financial US firms from CSRwire and explored
   exogeneous variation in stock valuation driven by institutional price
   pressure. Our empirical results show that firms facing stock market
   undervaluation are more likely than others to release CSR news. This
   effect is concentrated among firms exhibiting low levels of CSR
   commitment and low stock price informativeness. Finally, we provide
   evidence that the stock market reacts positively to CSR news released by
   undervalued firms and more so for undervalued firms with high
   information asymmetry.

AB The analysis of occupants' perception can improve building indoor
   environmental quality (IEQ). Going beyond conventional surveys, this
   study presents an innovative analysis of occupants' feedback about the
   IEQ of different workplaces based on web-scraping and text-mining of
   online job reviews. A total of 1,158,706 job reviews posted on Glassdoor
   about 257 large organizations (with more than 10,000 employees) are
   scraped and analyzed. Within these reviews, 10,593 include complaints
   about at least one IEQ aspect. The analysis of this large number of
   feedbacks referring to several workplaces is the first of its kind and
   leads to two main results: (1) IEQ complaints mostly arise in workplaces
   that are not office buildings, especially regarding poor thermal and
   indoor air quality conditions in warehouses, stores, kitchens, and
   trucks; (2) reviews containing IEQ complaints are more negative than
   reviews without IEQ complaints. The first result highlights the need for
   IEQ investigations beyond office buildings. The second result
   strengthens the potential detrimental effect that uncomfortable IEQ
   conditions can have on job satisfaction. This study demonstrates the
   potential of User-Generated Content and text-mining techniques to
   analyze the IEQ of workplaces as an alternative to conventional surveys,
   for scientific and practical purposes.

   fabulous online e-commerce websites. The software is implemented using
   Scrapy and Django frameworks. The software is configured and evaluated
   across different e-commerce websites. Individual website generates a
   greater amount of data about the products that need to be scraped. The
   proposed software provides the ability to search a target product in a
   single consolidated place instead of searching across various websites,
   such as amazon.com, alibaba.com and daraz.pk. Furthermore, the
   scheduling mechanism enables the scraper to execute at a required

AB Deriving meaningful insights from massive amount of user-generated
   contents is not a trivial task.To tackle this issue, this study proposes
   an integrated text mining framework to uncover important latent
   dimensions buried in the textual information to efficiently track the
   changes in the dimensions over time by covariate of interests. In doing
   so, this study applies two stages of text analytics of sentiment
   analysis and topic model utilizing consumer reviews scraped from a
   popular online review site. The sentiment analysis is conducted as an
   objective measure to classify the polarity of reviews in order to
   leverage positive ones connotative of strengths and negative ones
   connotative of weaknesses. Subsequently, the structural topic model(STM)
   discovers dimensions(topics). In the STM, each customer review is
   represented as a probabilistic distribution over a set of underlying
   dimensions. This interdisciplinary approach highlights several
   implications theoretically and practically and the research framework
   leverages textual information to uncover, track, and compare the latent
   dimensions, and enables us to understand the relationships among the
   dimensions and covariates of interest.

AB As enterprises expand and post increasing information about their
   business activities on their websites, website data promises to be a
   valuable source for investigating innovation. This article examines the
   practicalities and effectiveness of web mining as a research method for
   innovation studies. We use web mining to explore the R&D activities of
   296 UK-based green goods small and mid-size enterprises. We find that
   website data offers additional insights when compared with other
   traditional unobtrusive research methods, such as patent and publication
   analysis. We examine the strengths and limitations of enterprise
   innovation web mining in terms of a wide range of data quality
   dimensions, including accuracy, completeness, currency, quantity,
   flexibility and accessibility. We observe that far more companies in our
   sample report undertaking R&D activities on their web sites than would
   be suggested by looking only at conventional data sources. While
   traditional methods offer information about the early phases of R&D and
   invention through publications and patents, web mining offers insights
   that are more downstream in the innovation process. Handling website
   data is not as easy as alternative data sources, and care needs to be
   taken in executing search strategies. Website information is also
   self-reported and companies may vary in their motivations for posting
   (or not posting) information about their activities on websites.
   Nonetheless, we find that web mining is a significant and useful
   complement to current methods, as well as offering novel insights not
   easily obtained from other unobtrusive sources.

AB Website categorization has recently emerged as a very important task in
   several contexts. A huge amount of information is freely available
   through websites, and it could be used for example to accomplish
   statistical surveys, saving in costs. However, the information of
   interest for the specific categorization has to be mined among that huge
   amount. This turns out to be a difficult task in practice. In this work
   we propose a practically viable procedure to perform website
   categorization, based on the automatic generation of data records
   summarizing the content of each entire website. This is obtained by
   using web scraping and optical character recognition, followed by a
   number of nontrivial text mining and feature engineering steps. When
   such records have been produced, we use classification algorithms to
   categorize the websites according to the aspect of interest We compare
   in this task Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,
   Random Forest and Logistic classifiers. Since in many practical cases
   the training set labels are physiologically noisy, we analyze the
   robustness of each technique with respect to the presence of
   misclassified training records. We present results on real-world data
   for the problem of the detection of websites providing e-commerce
   facilities, however our approach is not structurally limited to this
   case. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB News media are important for society, because they provide information
   on relevant topics based on journalistic norms, such as truthfulness and
   impartiality. However, traditional news brands have found new
   competition in non-journalistic digital media. Google and YouTube have
   disrupted the business model of journalism by creating platforms on
   which everything and everyone competes for consumers' attention. Despite
   the recognised importance of this topic, empirical studies about the
   competitive situation of (journalistic) news media brands in the
   limitless digital media market are scarce. The aim of this study is to
   investigate the extent to which non-journalistic competitors replace
   traditional news media brands in relation to relevant topics. A
   programmed web scraping software automatically gathered Google and
   YouTube search results of trending topics (e.g. Industry 4.0,
   Blockchain, or CRISPR). Afterwards, a manual content analysis was
   conducted to classify the source of each search result (e.g. news media
   brand, corporate publisher, non-governmental organisation) (N = 556
   Google results and 792 YouTube results). The findings show that news
   media brands still dominate on Google but placed a distant third on
   YouTube, behind amateurs and corporate publishing. News media brands
   should reconsider their strategies for YouTube with regard to presenting
   their content.

AB The rise of e-commerce websites, as new shopping channels, led to an
   upsurge of review sites for a wide range of services and products. This
   provides an opportunity to use aspect-based sentiment analysis and mine
   opinions expressed from text which can help consumers decide what to
   purchase and businesses to better monitor their reputation and
   understand the needs of the market. Aspect-based sentiment analysis
   (ABSA) is a technique aimed to foster research beyond sentence or
   text-level sentiment classification. The goal is to identify opinions
   expressed about specific entities (e.g., laptops) and their aspects
   (e.g., price, performance, build quality, etc.). There exist very few
   techniques which can generate such results based on customer ratings,
   however usually for a limited set of pre-defined aspects and not from
   free-text reviews. The other challenge in this process is cold start
   problem because of the lack of enough review data for a product. In this
   paper, a methodology is proposed to automatically compute sentiments of
   dynamic aspects from user-generated reviews from the web scraping from
   multiple sources to overcome the cold start problem. Therefore, this
   methodology is devising a better solution for understanding sentiments
   in e-commerce than existing methods.

AB The main aim of this article is to examine the characteristics of Airbnb
   networks in the context of the potential impact on local residents and
   the traditional hotel industry. The analysis is based on a unique
   dataset that was constructed by the web-scraping of Airbnb listing data
   and hotel offers available at Booking.com in Paris, Barcelona, Berlin,
   and Warsaw. The empirical analysis reveals that only a minority of
   Airbnb listings can be classified as sharing economy services, while
   commercial offers constitute a significant share of listings on the
   platform. Although Airbnb facilitates the spread of tourism to areas not
   covered by the traditional hotel industry, it is also highly
   concentrated in neighbourhoods that have long attracted travellers, and
   thus contributes to increasing pressure from tourism. This comparative
   study also shows that Airbnb and traditional hotels compete for
   travellers across a wide range of market segments, but the
   substitutability of their offers is constrained by their complementary
   relationships in specific city areas. The study addresses crucial
   research gaps, presents a robust methodology, and provides a detailed

AB Purpose The purpose of this study paper is to focus on developing novel
   ways to monitor an economy in real time during the COVID-19 pandemic. A
   fully automated framework is proposed for collecting and analyzing
   online food prices in Poland. This is important, as the COVID-19
   outbreak in Europe in 2020 has led many governments to impose lockdowns
   that have prevented manual price data collection from food outlets. The
   study primarily addresses whether food price inflation can be accurately
   measured during the pandemic using only a laptop and Internet
   connection, without needing to rely on official statistics.
   Design/methodology/approach The big data approach was adopted to track
   food price inflation in Poland. Using the web-scraping technique, daily
   price information about individual food and non-alcoholic beverage
   products sold in online stores was gathered. Findings Based on raw
   online data, reliable estimates of monthly and annual food inflation
   were provided about 30 days before final official indexes were
   published. Originality/value This is the first paper to focus on
   measuring inflation in real time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Monthly
   and annual food price inflation are estimated in real time and updated
   daily, thereby improving previous forecasting solutions with weekly or
   monthly indicators. Using daily frequency price data deepens
   understanding of price developments and enables more timely detection of
   inflation trends, both of which are useful for policymakers and market
   participants. This study also provides a review of crucial issues
   regarding inflation that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Recently, it has been found that e-commerce (EC) websites provide a
   large amount of useful information that exceed the human cognitive
   processing capacity. In order to help customers in comparing
   alternatives when buying a product, previous research authors have
   designed opinion summarization systems based on customer reviews. They
   ignored the template information provided by manufacturers, although its
   descriptive information has the most useful product characteristics and
   texts are linguistically correct, unlike reviews. Therefore, this paper
   proposes a methodology coined as SEOpinion (summarization and
   exploration of opinions) to summarize aspects and spot opinion(s)
   regarding them using a combination of template information with customer
   reviews in two main phases. First, the hierarchical aspect extraction
   (HAE) phase creates a hierarchy of aspects from the template.
   Subsequently, the hierarchical aspect-based opinion summarization (HAOS)
   phase enriches this hierarchy with customers' opinions to be shown to
   other potential buyers. To test the feasibility of using deep
   learning-based BERT techniques with our approach, we created a corpus by
   gathering information from the top five EC websites for laptops. The
   experimental results showed that recurrent neural network (RNN) achieved
   better results (77.4% and 82.6% in terms of F1-measure for the first and
   second phases, respectively) than the convolutional neural network (CNN)
   and the support vector machine (SVM) technique.

AB There is a concern among social scientists and policymakers that the
   COVID-19 crisis might permanently change the nature of work. We study
   how labor demand in Mexico has been affected during the pandemic by web
   scraping job ads from a leading job search website. As in the U.S., the
   number of vacancies in Mexico declined sharply during the lockdown (38
   percent). In April there was a change in the composition of labor
   demand, and wages dropped across the board. By May, however, the wage
   distribution and the distribution of job ads by occupation returned to
   their pre-pandemic levels. Overall, there was a slight decline in
   specific requirements (gender and age), no change in required
   experience, and a temporary increase in demand for low-skilled workers.
   Contrary to expectations, opportunities for telecommuting diminished
   during the pandemic. Using a simple Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we
   find that the variation in the average advertised wage in April is
   explained more by a higher proportion of low-wage occupations than by a
   reduction in the wages paid for particular occupations. In sum, we find
   no evidence of a significant or permanent change in labor demand during
   the pandemic in Mexico.

   women. It especially queries its alleged emancipatory effects. To
   highlight the diversity of the platform's uses, a typology of three
   profiles is proposed: the hobbyists, the aspiring professionals and the
   successful sellers. These three types are crossed with four criteria to
   analyze work and its limits on web platforms: the income, the
   professional status or lack thereof, the vernacular designation of the
   activity and the place of the activity in space and time. The results
   are based on quantitative data - coming from web scraping on the 14,415
   Etsy French shops - and qualitative data - especially 16 interviews with

AB U.S. overdose deaths attributed to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl,
   have increased from under 3,000 in 2013 to nearly 20,000 in 2016, making
   up half of all opioid-related overdose deaths. Using web scrapes of
   darknet markets from 2014 to 2016, I provide historical prices for
   fentanyl and its most popular analogues and find that fentanyl vendors
   priced fentanyl in 2014 at a 90% discount compared to an equivalent dose
   of heroin. Using regression discontinuity, I evaluate the effects of two
   major law enforcement and regulatory events. I find minimal lasting
   effects of U.S. legal actions intended to disrupt darknet markets, but
   there are statistically significant indications of a price increase
   corresponding with regulatory action in China. Despite these indications
   of some regulatory success, fentanyl prices remained approximately 90%
   cheaper than heroin. (JEL I18, K42)

AB Introduction Cryptomarkets operating on the darknet are a recent
   phenomenon that has gained importance only over the last couple of years
   (Barratt, 2012). However, they now constitute an evolving part of
   illicit drug markets. Although selling and buying a variety of
   psychoactive substances on the Internet has a long history, new
   technological developments enable systematic drug trading on the
   net.These technological innovations on the Internet allow users to
   proceed with (illicit) drug transactions with almost completely
   anonymous identities and locations. In this paper, we provide a
   systematic measurement analysis of structures and trends on the most
   popular anonymous drug marketplace, and discuss the role of
   cryptomarkets in drug distribution.
   Methods: Data collection and analysis include a long-term measurement of
   the cryptomarket 'AlphaBay', the most popular platform during the survey
   period. By developing and applying a web-scraping tool, market data was
   extracted from the marketplace on a daily basis during a period of
   twelve months between September 2015 and August 2016. The data was
   analysed by using business-intelligence software, which allows the
   linking of various data sets. We found 2188 unique vendors offering
   11,925 drug items. The findings of our long-term monitoring and data
   analysis are compared over time and across marketplaces, offering a
   detailed understanding of the development of revenues generated,
   characterisation of countries of origin and destination, and
   distribution of vendors and customers over time.
   Results: We provide a nuanced and highly detailed longitudinal analysis
   of drug trading on the darknet marketplace 'AlphaBay', which was the
   largest cryptomarket in operation. 1) Total sales volumes for the
   'drugs' section was estimated at approximately USD 94 million for the
   period from September 2015 to August 2016. 2) In addition, about 64% of
   all sales are made with cocaine-, cannabis-, heroin-, and
   ecstasy-related products. 3) Average selling prices increase over time
   for categories including cannabis and hashish, ecstasy, opioids,
   psychedelics and stimulants. 4) The five most frequent countries of
   origin as indicated by vendors are the United States, United Kingdom,
   Australia, the Netherlands and Germany. Moreover, it was demonstrated
   that drug distribution on cryptomarkets is conducted at a regional
   rather than global level. 6) Furthermore, 4.88% of vendors made over USD
   200,000 and were responsible for 52.9% of total revenues generated over
   the period analysed. In contrast, 57.51% of vendors managed to sell drug
   items worth less than USD 10,000 within a period of twelve months. The
   findings suggest that 'AlphaBay' was a cryptomarket mainly from and for
   Western industrialised countries. In contrast, countries of the global
   South are neither among the main countries of origin nor destination
   countries.

   This study aims to show how to build a framework of an analytical system

   retrieved from an academic social network. Acquired data are used to
   find out the main differences between ResarchGate (RG) usage and values
   of metrics owned by scientists of different gender, scientific title and
   field of study to find out if various groups of employees can be

   The authors apply web scraping technique for collecting data from
   university web page (2847 employees) and use R scripts to acquire the
   metrics form RG portal. Also, data of 1497 researchers and teaching
   workers from 11 faculties at Polish university were explored.
   The descriptive statistics, Chi square test, ANOVA and logistic
   regression were used to analyse the main RG metrics: RG Score, number of
   publications, reads and citations.
   Analysis shows the significant differences both in terms of popularity
   of ResearchGate and values of its main metrics. The research confirmed
   that 1) the rvest package allows for fast data acquisition from RG, 2)
   RG metrics can be used by university managers to compare achievements
   and progress of single researchers, research labs, departments or
   faculties, 3) Researchers employed at the faculties of formal and
   natural sciences use RG portal more frequently, possess higher values of
   RG metrics, therefore different types of workers and various branches of

AB Urban tourism is an important activity in cities today. It is
   responsible for the transformation and specialization of multiple urban
   areas around the world, which is not without problems. Research on it
   has only been carried out on large cities, with a knowledge gap in
   relation to lower-scale urban categories. Accommodation is the basic
   infrastructure that supports it, its location being an indicator of
   tourist suitability. The aim of this work is to know which environmental
   factors and to what extent they support the choice of accommodation
   according to its location. For this purpose, the studied accommodations
   are geocoded, influencing factors are mapped, and spatial and proximity
   analyses are carried out. Subsequently, the correlation between
   environmental factors and travellers' post-purchase web evaluations is
   statistically verified. The results show how urban tourism is spatially
   distributed according to patterns based on land use and proximity to
   tourist attractions. There is evidence of a typical tourist structure of
   medium-sized cities made up of well-valued accommodation locations close
   to heritage tourist concentrations located within the historic centre.
   The results can be useful for private investment and planning to improve
   these cities.

   research and practice. To this end, we utilized multiple data sources:
   surveys of service scholars and practitioners, web scraping of online
   documents, a review of published service scholarship, and roundtable
   discussions conducted at the world's foremost service research centers.
   We incorporated innovative methodologies, including machine learning,
   natural language processing, and qualitative analyses, to identify key
   service research priorities that are critical to address during these
   turbulent times. The first two priorities-technology and the changing
   nature of work and technology and the customer experience-focus on
   leveraging technology for service provision and consumption. The next
   two priorities-resource and capability constraints and customer
   proactivity for well-being-focus on responding to the changing needs of
   multiple stakeholders. Further, we identified a set of stakeholder-wants
   from the literature and include research questions that tie key
   stakeholder-wants to each of the four priorities. We believe the set of
   research priorities in the present article offer actionable ideas for
   service research directions in this challenging environment.

AB This paper estimates the pass-through of the largest tax on
   sugar-sweetened beverages enacted in the U.S., which is two cents per
   ounce in Boulder, Colorado. A strength of the paper is that, to achieve
   as complete a perspective as possible, we estimate the pass-through of
   the tax not only to beverage prices in retail stores but also to those
   in restaurants, and we examine data for the treatment community of
   Boulder and a comparison community of Fort Collins, Colorado, from four
   sources: (a) hand-collected data on prices from stores; (b) Nielsen
   Retail Scanner Data of store prices; (c) hand-collected data on prices
   in restaurants; and (d) web-scraped data from online restaurant menus.
   Across the multiple datasets, we find consistent evidence that the tax
   was largely, but not completely, passed through to consumers. In both
   the hand-collected store data and restaurant data, pass-through is
   slightly less than 75%, whereas pass-through is just over 50% using the
   scanner data; consumers bear most, but not all, of the largest tax on
   sugar-sweetened beverages in the United States.

AB In "Web Scraping for Hospitality Research: Overview, Opportunities, and
   Implications," Han and Anderson present the tools and methods for
   collecting online data through data scraping. Although the article
   describes in detail the processes for gathering data, and presented
   recent court rulings that allow data scraping in the United States, it
   did not adequately address the ethical collection of online data. The
   internet has opened up new opportunities to research interesting
   questions and to collect data much faster than has been possible in the
   past. The emergence of online databases and social media sites enables
   new lines of research while at the same time introducing new ethical
   questions for both researchers and institutional research boards (IRBs).
   Using web-based data for research is not new. However, as Han and
   Anderson point out, a 2019 ruling (HiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn
   Corporation, appeal from the United States District Court) has redefined
   what is legal in online data collection. In the following, we highlight
   some of the key legal and ethical issues around the use of scraped data
   for academic research with the intent of ensuring researchers,
   reviewers, and editors are cognizant of some of these (evolving) issues.

AB The Internet has had a vast and pervasive impact on the education
   industry, one of which is the creation of an online educational
   marketplace. This study investigates the online marketplace for business
   courses by viewing it as part of the platform economy. Data pertaining
   to 9064 business courses was collected from the Udemy website using a
   web scraper tool. The analysis of the data reveals that the demand for
   MOOCs in business is great, with an average of 3169 students enrolled in
   each course, with some courses surpassing 100,000 students. The demand
   varies between categories, with business & data analytics, and
   entrepreneurship being among the most popular categories. The results
   also show that course enrollment in courses is highly skewed, giving
   support for the notion that power asymmetries that seem to arise in such
   decentralized markets. Finally, the analysis reveals that not all
   participants in the online marketplace for business education benefit
   equally. Specifically, the study found that courses tended to have a
   higher enrollment rate when the course provider was male. Finally, the
   analysis showed that despite increasing academic interest in online
   education, academics have been slow to enter the digital marketplace as
   service providers.

AB The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the
   second-largest and most contentious public assistance program
   administered by the United States government. The media forums where
   SNAP discourse occurs have changed with the advent of social and
   web-based media. We used machine learning techniques to characterize
   media coverage of SNAP over time (1990-2017), between outlets with
   national readership and those with narrower scopes, and, for a subset of
   web-based media, by the outlet's political leaning. We applied
   structural topic models, a machine learning methodology that categorizes
   and summarizes large bodies of text that have document-level covariates
   or metadata, to a corpus of print media retrieved via LexisNexis (n =
   76,634). For comparison, we complied a separate corpus via web-scrape
   algorithm of the Google News API (2012-2017), and assigned political
   alignment metadata to a subset documents according to a recent study of
   partisanship on social media. A similar procedure was used on a subset
   of the print media documents that could be matched to the same alignment
   index. Using linear regression models, we found some, but not all,
   topics to vary significantly with time, between large and small media
   outlets, and by political leaning. Our findings offer insights into the
   polarized and partisan nature of a major social welfare program in the
   United States, and the possible effects of new media environments on the
   state of this discourse.

AB In IS research, there is a dichotomy where design science and behavioral
   science are distinct research paradigms. IS researchers should view
   these paradigms as complementary with research drawing upon the
   strengths of both, yet few have done so. This work demonstrates how
   design science and behavioral science can be united in IS research via
   counterfeit product detection based on product reviews in an online
   marketplace. Product authenticity in the online marketplace is a common
   issue plaguing consumers. The decision process.involved in determining
   product authenticity is lengthy and complex. Despite the pressing need
   for an automatic authenticity rating system for online shopping, little
   research has been done to develop such a system and assess its effects
   on consumer purchase behavior. To respond to this need, our study
   develops a design artifact, called OnCDS, to automatically calculate the
   likelihood that a product is counterfeit based on online customer
   reviews. Drawing upon lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches and
   TF-IDF as kernel theories for our design, we employ web scraping,
   natural language processing, and topic analysis methods to process
   customer reviews and calculate the counterfeit score of a product. In
   assessing the effects of OnCDS on consumer behavior, we develop a
   research model that encompasses trust and perceived risk based on the
   valence framework. Results show that our design artifact's efficacy is
   validated and that the,counterfeit score affects perceived risk and
   trust, which in turn influences attitude toward purchase. (C) 2017

AB The United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural
   Statistics Service (NASS) has the responsibility of quantifying the
   nation's agricultural production. Historically, it has focused on large
   production agriculture. With interest and activity increasing in urban
   areas, NASS has begun exploring how to better quantify urban
   agriculture. This segment of agriculture is particularly challenging to
   enumerate because the agricultural holdings tend to be small, diverse,
   widely dispersed, and more transient than the predominantly large farms
   in rural areas. In collaboration with the Multi-Agency Collaboration
   Environment (MACE), a new approach to list building was explored in a
   pilot study conducted in the City of Baltimore, Maryland. Using a big
   data approach, areas of potential agricultural activity were identified
   by gathering information (state and local permits, Facebook and twitter
   feeds, interest groups, etc.) via the web. A sample was drawn from the
   list, and an in-person survey was conducted to assess whether or not the
   identified areas had agricultural activity. The results of the pilot
   study are presented. Lessons learned from the study and next steps are
   discussed.

AB Understanding the distribution of online consumer ratings for food
   products can provide insights that aid supply chain decisions. Using a
   researcher-collected web-scraped panel data set from Amazon, this
   article quantifies the effect of number of ratings, average rating,
   variance of ratings, and skewness of the rating distribution. Results
   show that the number of ratings and each of these moments of the
   distribution of online consumer ratings affect ground coffee sales
   ranking. The size of the effect of the distribution of ratings was found
   to vary with respect to the sales level of the coffee products. The
   results suggest that the distribution of online ratings plays an
   important informational role in e-commerce platforms. As online grocery
   shopping continues to increase in popularity, a greater understanding of
   how online ratings and reviews may impact sales or products are needed
   by those in the agricultural and food supply chain. In particular, these
   results provide retail managers with an array of online consumer rating
   attributes to use in their demand forecasts. [EconLit citations: D12,

AB This paper examines how customer sentiment expressed through social
   media influences institutional investors' investment decisions and firm
   value. We use psychology theory to classify the emotional content of
   social media-based word of mouth, which we refer to as ESWOM. We examine
   whether ESWOM influences institutional investors' stockholdings
   differentially based on investor type and if institutional investors'
   stockholdings mediate the relation between ESWOM and firm value. We
   identify eight types of ESWOM by linguistically interpreting web
   scrapings of millions of social media posts on 38 corporate brands for
   the 2007-2015 period. We find differential effects of ESWOM on
   stockholdings of institutional investors. Dedicated and quasi-index
   institutional investors increase their stockholdings in response to
   increases in positive ESWOM such as joy and trust. Transient investors
   decrease their stockholdings in response to increases in negative ESWOM
   such as anger, disgust, and fear. Competitive intensity and intangible
   asset intensity influence these results. Path analysis indicates that
   ESWOM influences firm abnormal stock returns and idiosyncratic risk both
   directly and indirectly through. its effects on institutional investors'
   stockholdings. These findings support our hypothesis that investors'
   responses to customer sentiment vary based on whether they follow
   long-term or short-term investment strategies. Our research highlights
   the importance of understanding the heterogeneous preferences of
   institutional investors and their use of social media information for
   decision making.

   research in Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (M&SOM). We
   review 91 empirically focused papers published in M&SOM since its
   inception in 1999, classifying them based on data type and data
   collection methodology. The results show that although empirical
   operations management research has made great strides thus far,
   empirical research still lags analytic modeling, and much work remains
   to be done. We call on operations management scholars to broaden and
   increase their use of empirical tools as a vital source of new knowledge
   creation; and we highlight the benefits of filling methodological gaps,
   especially in case and survey research. Drawing on the dynamics
   associated with paradigm shifts, we offer a new research paradigm that
   we term combinative research value, in which these two empirical
   techniques, coupled with other approaches (e.g., web scraping, analyses
   of big data, and/or analytic modeling), can help accelerate our
   understanding of changing operating strategies and practices. We
   advocate for a tighter integration of analytical and empirical
   operations management knowledge in order to address the challenges and
   opportunities of the fast-paced, enormous forces of change in the 21st
   century.

   1860 as a large unexpected economic shock. Mined gold was an unexpected
   and large economic shock of up to 3.5% of GDP. This provides as good as
   random variation to the local economy that I use to estimate the effect
   of economic changes on suicides. Comprehensive mortality data by state
   and year does not exist for the US for 1840-1860. Thus, I use
   web-scraped data from a newspaper archive and use suicide mentions per
   100,000 pages to proxy for suicides. Overall, results show that mined
   gold is linked with an apparent reduction in newspaper suicide mentions
   in line with previous research.

AB Through its electronic filing system EDGAR, the U.S. Securities and
   Exchange Commission (SEC) provides information that listed companies are
   required to report. However, while the information is thus made public,
   it is not readily available. This article explains the purpose of the
   SEC and its EDGAR filing system, how it works and how anyone can access
   this information. It further explains how companies file their material
   contracts as attachments to their filings and how to find them. The
   paper also explains the development of a program for mining EDGAR,
   resulting in the extraction of over six hundred JV contracts. Finally,
   the paper explores basic text mining techniques to dissect the contracts
   and point out the most widely used clauses, such as joint venture type
   and scope, the laws governing the contract and the description and
   responsibilities of the parties and opens a broad research agenda.

AB The activity of procurement is one such activity that is not only
   crucial for any organization from the fiscal point of view but also
   involves a great deal of lucubration both on human and software fronts.
   In this paper, we discuss about a chatbot developed to automate this
   tedious process. FinderBuddy is a procurement bot i.e. it is a chatbot
   designed to facilitate the procurement process in industries. (Here,
   FinderBuddy was designed for a simple office building where the bulk of
   work is on desk work. Hence the supplies in the database are
   predominantly stationery items and office supplies).It enables all the
   important features like issuing of desired items from the inventory,
   procuring best deals of materials from suppliers, etc. Apart from these,
   it also offers advanced features like processing natural language input
   (apart from accepting queries in a well-defined syntax), accepting voice
   input, delivering audio output, displaying items running short in the
   inventory, updating quantities of items in the inventory, tracking pre
   placed orders, changing orders still in processing, cancelling orders,
   reordering past orders, checking availability of various items in the
   inventory, review of past orders, spell check etc. Thus the chat bot
   provides all possible features to make the procurement process lucid,
   smooth and user friendly with least human intervention. The design
   involves crucial use of database concepts, Natural Language Processing,
   Web Scraping and Speech-to-Text (and vice versa) conversion. The
   implementation is carried out in Python and SQL using varied APIs.

AB Fashion color trends are an essential marketing element that directly
   affect brand sales. Organizations such as Pantone have global authority
   over professional color standards by annually forecasting color
   palettes. However, the question remains whether fashion designers apply
   these colors in fashion shows that guide seasonal fashion trends. This
   study analyzed image data from fashion collections through machine
   learning to obtain measurable results by web-scraping catwalk images,
   separating body and clothing elements via machine learning, defining a
   selection of color chips using k-means algorithms, and analyzing the
   similarity between the Pantone color palette (16 colors) and the
   analysis color chips. The gap between the Pantone trends and the colors
   used in fashion collections were quantitatively analyzed and found to be
   significant. This study indicates the potential of machine learning
   within the fashion industry to guide production and suggests further
   research expand on other design variables.

AB Public choice literature divides the rationality of voting between
   instrumental and expressive. In this paper, we take the Vermont
   legislature in passing the H. 57 bill as a case to explain some of the
   determinants of expressive voting empirically. The H.57 bill declares
   that no government entity can interfere with, or restrict, a consenting
   individual's right to abortion care across the entire gestation period.
   However, the bill has not changed the previously status quo of the state
   towards abortion rights. Thus, it creates a situation in which we can
   analyze the legislator's voting behavior through the lens of an
   expressive voting framework. We utilize a high dimensional dataset and
   post-double-selection LASSO method to explain the channels that
   influence the expressive voting on the H. 57 bill. We web scrape the
   lower and upper chamber voting data on H.57 bill and use the 2017
   American Community Survey 5-year estimates to retrieve 89 different
   socioeconomic, housing, and demographic characteristics of State
   Legislative Districts. Our results suggest channels of poverty, gender,
   and population diversity are some crucial mechanisms.

AB Big Data refers to the highly growing digital data collections that
   involve data with different formats, including structured,
   semi-structured, and unstructured datasets. Analyzing these combinations
   requires capabilities beyond the traditional database management
   systems' abilities. Among most sources of big data appears e-markets and
   social media platforms as significant contributors. This distinction is
   due to its features that facilitate consumers to express their views or
   opinions about specific products and services. Customer reviews and
   ratings become a significant resource for both consumers and firms
   regarding their plentiful and valuable knowledge. The proposed work
   introduces a big data framework to analyze such reviews and ratings,
   starting with data collection from different sources. Followed by
   integrating the collected data, which comes in different formats, toward
   the further processing phase. Finally, the analysis and visualization
   steps to draw the conclusions. Our work was tested on real data

AB This work presents a text mining context and its use for a deep analysis
   of the messages delivered by politicians. Specifically, we deal with an
   expert systems-based exploration of the rhetoric dynamics of a large
   collection of US Presidents' speeches, ranging from Washington to Trump.
   In particular, speeches are viewed as complex expert systems whose
   structures can be effectively analyzed through rank-size laws. The
   methodological contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we develop a
   text mining-based procedure for the construction of the dataset by using
   a web scraping routine on the Miller Center website - the repository
   site collecting the speeches. Second, we explore the implicit structure
   of the discourse data by implementing a rank-size procedure over the
   individual speeches, being the words of each speech ranked in terms of
   their frequencies. The scientific significance of the proposed
   combination of text mining and rank-size approaches can be found in its
   flexibility and generality, which let it be reproducible to a wide set
   of expert systems and text mining contexts. The usefulness of the
   proposed method and of the speeches analysis is demonstrated by the
   findings themselves. Indeed, in terms of impact, it is worth noting that
   interesting conclusions of social, political and linguistic nature on
   how 45 United States Presidents, from April 30, 1789 till February 28,
   2017 delivered political messages can be carried out. Indeed, the
   proposed analysis shows some remarkable regularities, not only inside a
   given speech, but also among different speeches. Moreover, under a
   purely methodological perspective, the presented contribution suggests
   possible ways of generating a linguistic decision-making algorithm. (C)

AB The rapid expansion of Big Data Analytics is forcing companies to
   rethink their Human Resource (HR) needs. However, at the same time, it
   is unclear which types of job roles and skills constitute this area. To
   this end, this study pursues to drive clarity across the heterogeneous
   nature of skills required in Big Data professions, by analyzing a large
   amount of real-world job posts published online. More precisely we: 1)
   identify four Big Data 'job families'; 2) recognize nine homogeneous
   groups of Big Data skills (skill sets) that are being demanded by
   companies; 3) characterize each job family with the appropriate level of
   competence required within each Big Data skill set. We propose a novel,
   semi-automated, fully replicable, analytical methodology based on a
   combination of machine learning algorithms and expert judgement. Our
   analysis leverages a significant amount of online job posts, obtained
   through web scraping, to generate an intelligible classification of job
   roles and skill sets. The results can support business leaders and HR
   managers in establishing clear strategies for the acquisition and the
   development of the right skills needed to leverage Big Data at best.
   Moreover, the structured classification of job families and skill sets
   will help establish a common dictionary to be used by HR recruiters and
   education providers, so that supply and demand can more effectively meet
   in the job marketplace. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses empirical evidences on the effects of diplomatic
   conflicts with neighboring countries on the value of industry and
   corporations. After the Cold War era, diplomatic conflicts among
   countries are increasingly being treated as economic sanctions, and
   Korea-China conflict over THAAD deployment is proceeding similarly. As
   such, diplomatic conflict can have a significant impact on the stock and
   financial markets of the country, and is viewed as a potential risk to
   industries and firms. However, there is no concrete and empirical
   research on the extent to which these diplomatic conflicts actually have
   an impact on the value of each industry and firm. One reason is that it
   is unclear about the specific measures that can be used to verify the
   link between the countries subject to diplomatic conflict and domestic
   firms. In this study, we examine the effects of diplomatic conflict on
   corporate value by using an event study with World Input Output Table,
   history of company analysis and web scraping. As results, in the case of
   diplomatic conflict, we find no evidence of positive relationship
   between the industrial relations and corporate values. However, there is
   a negative impact on corporate value, whether investing in China through
   affiliated companies, inherent sensitivity of individual companies, and
   high exposure to news related to THAAD.

AB In recent years, European research policies and priorities in the
   agricultural sector have been developed through industry-based
   partnerships sponsored by the European Commission (EC). In 2004, the EC
   regulated a form of partnership called European Technology Platform
   (ETP) with the aim to define research agendas that would attract private
   investment.
   Monitoring the impact and performance of public policies, such as the
   implementation of ETPs, is basic for policy-makers. However, assessing
   the performance of ETPs frequently result into costly efforts given the
   current lack of indicators to monitor their variety of activities. In
   addition, since most ETPs have been set up recently it is difficult to
   assess their results, which are typically revealed after some time and
   take a considerable amount of time to be captured and processed with
   traditional methods such as surveys.
   In this study, we propose to assess the dynamics of ETPs through
   measures based on online information, given that it is fresh, available
   in real-time and is a publicly reflect of the activities of
   organizations. We firstly consider an ETP as an innovation intermediary
   and define its functions according to innovation literature. Then, we
   enumerate the particular activities within each function in which the
   ETP may be involved. To monitor such functions and activities, some
   indicators based on online data are proposed.
   This conceptual basis has been put into practice with a particular case
   study based on the agri-food technology platform "TP Organics".
   Preliminary results show that the online-based indicators are able to
   measure the level of activity of the platform, if its scope is expanding
   or reducing, and how the importance of the different functions has
   evolved over time.

AB The proportion of tenants will undoubtedly rise in Poland, where at
   present, the ownership housing model is very dominant. As a result, the
   rental housing market in Poland is currently under-researched in
   comparison with owner-occupancy. In order to narrow this research gap,
   this study attempts to identify the determinants affecting rental prices
   in Cracow. The latter were obtained from the internet platform otodom.pl
   using the web scraping technique. To identify rent determinants,
   ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and spatial econometric methods
   were used. In particular, traditional spatial autoregressive model (SAR)
   and spatial autoregressive geographically weighted regression (GWR-SAR)
   were employed, which made it possible to take into account the spatial
   heterogeneity of the parameters of determinants and the spatially
   changing spatial autocorrelation of housing rents. In-depth analysis of
   rent determinants using the GWR-SAR model exposed the complexity of the
   rental market in Cracow. Estimates of the above model revealed that many
   local markets can be identified in Cracow, with different factors
   shaping housing rents. However, one can identify some determinants that
   are ubiquitous for almost the entire city. This concerns mainly the
   variables describing the area of the flat and the age of the building.
   Moreover, the Monte Carlo test indicated that the spatial autoregressive
   parameter also changes significantly over space.

AB This paper investigates the effectiveness of liberalization policy on
   the intercity coach market in England and Wales and evaluates its impact
   in promoting competition and enhancing welfare. The paper adds to the
   current literature by assessing this policy focusing on natural
   monopolies, deriving a structural model of the industry and using
   web-scraped key market-level data in the study. Regression analysis and
   descriptive statistics suggest peripheral routes with a small market
   size are natural monopolies, where passengers pay higher prices. We
   estimate a structural model, currently absent from the literature, which
   shows that these routes are characterized by lower welfare levels. The
   model allows us to simulate a policy promoting competition on such
   routes showing that a regulator could generate net welfare gains by
   implementing a more competitive equilibrium on these routes. This paper
   confirms the dominant conclusion that unregulated coach industries
   detrimentally consolidate, as demonstrated in other European markets.

   validate reviews' length and sentiment as correlates of online reviews'
   ratings; and second, to understand the emotions embedded in online
   reviews and how they associate with specific words used in such reviews.
   Design/methodology/approach A panel data set of customer reviews was
   collected for auto, life, and home insurance from January 2012 to
   December 2015 using a web scraping technique. Using a sentiment analysis
   approach, 1,584 reviews for the auto, home, and life insurance services
   of 156 insurance companies were analyzed.
   Findings The results indicate that, since 2013, consumers have generally
   had more negative emotions than positive ones toward insurance services.
   The results also show that consumer review sentiment correlates
   positively and review length correlates negatively with consumer online
   review ratings. Furthermore, a two-way ANOVA analysis shows that, in
   general, short reviews with positive sentiment are associated with high
   review ratings.
   Practical implications The findings of this study provide service
   companies, in general, and insurance companies, in particular, with
   important guidelines that should be considered to increase consumers'
   positive attitude toward their services.
   Originality/value This paper highlights the importance of sentiment
   analysis in identifying consumer reviews' emotions and understanding the
   associations and interactions of reviews' length and sentiment on online
   review rating, which can lead to improved marketing strategies.

   This model is then used to test market efficiency in the Betfair
   'in-play' market for large sample of ODI matches. We find strong
   evidence of overreaction in the first innings. A trading strategy of
   betting on the batting team after the fall of a wicket produces a
   significant profit of 20%. We also find some evidence of underreaction
   in the second innings although it is less economically and statistically
   significant than the first innings overreaction. We also implement
   trades when the discrepancy between the probability of victory implied
   by current market odds differs substantially from the odds estimated by
   our Monte Carlo simulation model. We document a number of trading
   strategies that yield large statistically significant positive returns
   in both the first and second innings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Abstract Recently, the number of studies about economic uncertainty has
   increased, in part due to the new techniques that allow the construction
   of appropriate proxies for uncertainty, fundamentally unobservable,
   specially the web-scrapping technique that allows to extract updated
   online information, and which has been frequently used in the
   construction of these indicators. Based on two of this uncertainty
   indicators, we investigate the dynamics and transition of uncertainty in
   Brazil using quantitative autoregressive representations. The results
   reveal asymmetric dynamic along different conditional quantiles,
   corroborated by the analysis of dispersion, amplitude and densities.
   Furthermore, it is suggested that there is a low or even null
   probability of migration from a high uncertainty condition to a low
   level and vice versa.
Y4 Resumo Recentemente, o número de estudos sobre incerteza na economia tem
   aumentado, em parte, devido às novas técnicas que permitem a construção
   de proxies adequadas para a incerteza, fundamentalmente não observável,
   com destaque à técnica de webscrapping, que permite extrair informações
   online e atualizadas, e que tem sido frequentemente utilizada na
   construção desses indicadores. Neste contexto, a partir de dois
   indicadores de incerteza, investiga-se a dinâmica e transição da
   incerteza no Brasil usando representações autorregressivas quantílicas.
   Os resultados revelam uma dinâmica assimétrica ao longo de diferentes
   quantis condicionais, corroborados pela análise de dispersão, amplitude
   e densidades. Ainda, sugere-se existência de baixa probabilidade, ou até
   mesmo nula, de migrar-se de um estado de alta incerteza para níveis
   baixos e vice-versa.

   skills of this job in Russia and the USA. To look into the framework of
   skills of the data analyst job in Russia, the authors used the web
   scraping method to download data from the website HH.ru about 100
   vacancies of the data analyst job in the RF. Then we used data parsing
   to find out about the requirements for candidates for a vacation and
   content analysis to classify the skills by categories presented in Verma
   et al. (2019). After we determined the framework of skills of the data
   analyst job in Russia, we compared it to the framework of skills of the
   job in the USA. The main conclusion is that out of 5 major skill
   categories only 3 coincided, namely: statistical packages, structured
   data management, decision making. But they were in different positions
   in terms of how frequently they were mentioned in vacancies. Also it
   should be noted that in the vacancies posted in Russia, programming
   skills are important, whilst in the American vacancies this category is
   not in the top 5 most frequent requirements for candidates. Moreover, in
   the American vacancies soft skills are most frequent, but in the Russian
   ones hard skill categories are more common.

AB Objectives: The finalized `Deeming Rule' extended the Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) authority to regulate e-cigarettes, cigars, and
   other newly deemed tobacco products. We seek to assess the neighborhood
   characteristics associated with retail violations of sales to minors
   (RVSM) by tobacco product.
   Study design: We collected national inspection data on tobacco retailers
   during August 8, 2016, and May 31, 2018, from the FDA compliance check
   database.
   Methods: A web scraping tool was applied to text mine the FDA decision
   letters and extract information on the tobacco product involved in RVSM.
   Separate logistic regression models with random effects were performed
   to examine the association between zip code-level neighborhood
   characteristics and RVSM by tobacco product.
   Results: Of 268,317 minor-involved compliance inspections, 35,403
   (13.2%) were identified as RVSM. Among 23,352 warning letters included
   in the final analysis, e-cigarettes, cigars, cigarettes, and smokeless
   tobacco accounted for 20.0% (n = 4673), 40.4% (9439), 35.6% (8303), and
   4.0% (937) of RVSM, respectively. Flavored tobacco products were
   abundant among underage sales. For e-cigarettes, RVSM were more likely
   to occur in zip codes with a larger proportion of youth population aged
   10-17 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.17 [1.02-1.34]). A larger
   proportion of African Americans was associated with a higher risk of
   RVSM for cigars (AOR = 1.09 [1.07-1.11]) but a lower risk of RVSM for
   e-cigarettes (AOR = 0.90 [0.87-0.93]).
   Conclusions: Retail violations of underage sales for cigars and
   e-cigarettes are prevalent and neighborhood characteristics associated
   with violations differ by tobacco product. Continued inspections with
   tailored strategies to reduce RVSM of all tobacco products are needed.

AB The presence of and proximity to water influences human settlement
   decisions, because water has been able to characterize the environment
   and affect human health since prehistoric times. Many scholars have
   studied the effects of environmental amenities on the real estate
   market; however, only a few of them have explored the effects of water.
   This study stresses the role of water with a focus on the dichotomy
   between artificial and natural waterways (canals vs. streams), which
   involves managerial and qualitative differences. A hedonic approach,
   based on a large web scraped and geo-referenced dataset of 10,530
   observations, is used to analyze the effect of water proximity and
   quality on residential housing prices in the province of Milan (Italy).
   Our main results show a significant but conflicting impact of water
   proximity on real estate value: reducing the canal distance, we observe
   an increase in the residential housing sale price, in urban more than
   peri-urban environments; in contrast, reducing the stream distance, our
   results show decreases in property value. Moreover, a significant
   moderating effect of water quality on distance from streams is
   identifiable.

AB The interaction between land use and transportation infrastructure is a
   topic that has been extensively researched and continues to be of
   interest as new underlying economic, infrastructure and environmental
   conditions emerge. In this research, the direct and indirect effects of
   transportation infrastructure and policies on house prices and rents are
   studied. Since real estate transaction data are not available, a
   web-scraping tool was developed to parse house prices and attributes
   from publicly available resources. Econometric models of two categories
   were then estimated: (1) hedonic price models, based on Ordinary Least
   Squares (OLS) and (2) spatial econometric models, such as the spatial
   regression model (SAR), spatial error (SEM), Durbin (SDM) and
   autocorrelation (SAC) model and Geographically Weighted Regression
   (GWR), which are increasingly used by econometricians in order to
   capture the effect of the - usually unobserved - spatial factors on
   house valuation.
   The results of this research indicate that proximity to transportation
   infrastructure has a direct impact on house and apartment purchase
   prices and rents, which is either positive or negative depending on the
   type of the transportation system. Metro, tram, suburban railway and bus
   stations affect the prices positively, while ISAP (the old urban railway
   of Attica) and national rail stations, airports and ports, have a
   negative effect, due to a number of externalities associated with them,
   such as noise.
   The obtained results are consistent with expectations and the
   literature. While these results cannot be assumed directly transferable
   to other locations and areas, they could be cautiously used as
   indications for planning applications (where dedicated models have not
   been developed). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accident databases are used to learn from past accidents and avoid
   future accidents in the chemical process industry. Classical accident
   databases can be tedious to use because the database entries were
   written over the years by various persons in different styles. Thus,
   accident case entries must be interpreted to identify cause-effect
   relationships and recognize lessons learned. Semantically enriched
   accident databases can make information retrieval more efficient. In
   this research approach Natural Language Processing methods are used to
   extract information from a chemical accident database. Additionally,
   substance information is enriched using web scraping techniques.
   Afterwards, a predefined ontology structure is automatically populated
   with the extracted information. The ontology-based chemical accident
   database provides additional accident exploration capabilities that can
   be used by human experts or computer systems. The results indicate that
   the proposed extraction method is well suited to extract accident
   information. The ontology is useful to discover causal accident
   relations due to the semantically described context of accident
   information. The method described can be adapted to other databases with
   minor adaptations and refinements. By combining various ontology-based
   accident databases a human and machine-processable, and sharable
   knowledge structure can be provided to reuse knowledge across companies
   and countries.

AB This research summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the
   scientific discussion on the issue of potential tax evasions and
   increased rental rates that one of innovative home-sharing platforms
   might causes. The study aims to find possible tax evasion that each
   property and each host can cause by considering creative activities in
   tourism marketing and a sharing economy platform, Airbnb in Prague.
   Besides, the authors identified the potential problems in the rental
   accommodation market. Systematization literary sources and approaches
   for solving the problem of sharing economy platforms indicate that
   although these platforms benefit for some economic, social and
   environmental issues, they pose some troubles in various markets.
   Regarding methodological tools of the research method, this paper used a
   web scraping technique to gain data from the Airbnb website. The authors
   analysed 13918 accommodations that were rented by 6768 Airbnb users
   between April 2016 and March 2017. In the study, the authors used the
   Microsoft Excel 2016 program and a model created by researchers to make
   calculations. The paper presented the results of an empirical analysis
   showing that in case the sensitive regulation of the number of nights
   will apply the potential tax incomes will lower only on 0.98% when
   considering accommodations and on 6.40% when considering users. In this
   case, 16832 rental units will appear in the long-term housing market.
   Moreover, tax evasion becomes more when considering each dwelling
   instead of each host because some users rented more than one rental
   accommodation. The research also empirically confirms and theoretically
   proves that that extended limits for overnight stays yield benefits for
   costs, supply and demand of rental housing. Those findings can be useful
   for governments, academicians that are interested in tourism marketing,
   firms in the accommodation industry that look for new marketing
   innovations and short or long-term housing market participants such as
   lessor and lessees.

AB Following the legalization and regulation of marijuana for recreational
   purposes in states with medical markets, policymakers and researchers
   seek empirical evidence on how, and how fast, supply and demand changed
   over time. Prices are an indication of how suppliers and consumers
   respond to policy changes, so this study uses a difference-in-difference
   approach to exploit the timing of policy implementation and identify the
   impacts on marijuana prices 4-5 months after markets opened. This study
   uses unique longitudinal survey data of prices paid by consumers and a
   web-scraped dataset of dispensary prices advertised online for three
   U.S. medical marijuana states that all eventually legalized recreational
   marijuana. Results indicate there were no impacts on the prices paid for
   medical or recreational marijuana by state-representative residents
   within the short 4- to 5-months window following legalization. However,
   there were differences in how much people paid if they obtained
   marijuana for recreational purposes from a recreational store. Further
   analysis of advertised prices confirms this result, but further
   demonstrates heterogeneous responses in prices across types of commonly
   advertised strains; prices either did not change or increased depending
   on the strain type. A key implication of our findings is that there are
   both supply and demand responses at work in the opening of legalized
   markets, suggesting that evaluations of immediate effects may not
   accurately reflect the long run impact of legalization on consumption.

   to design an approach via data mining, human psychology techniques in
   interaction to make a mobile application profitable by making a large
   share of users tend to use the application for some significant time
   more and hence increase the company's revenue via advertisements or

   increasing the profit of the company. Integration of human computer
   interaction psychology and data mining with Natural Language Processing
   techniques helps in achieving the goal. Focus is made in generation of
   recommended results and its eventual generation of "wh" questions like
   who/what/when from the recommended object's property. A web scrapper is
   implemented to automatically fetch the recommended item's information
   from the web. Questions are generated as a set and ranked within the
   set.The question having the highest rank among all is then picked and
   linked to the notifications of the application at regular intervals.This
   notification linkage is done in accordance with the exploitation of the
   human mind's tendency of attention due to curiosity. Survey performed to
   find the improvement in the hit rate of the application and show the

   labor relations, actualizing the task of exploring contractual practices
   and mechanisms introduced by them. Similar to other websites, online
   labor markets record huge amounts of diverse information about the users
   and their actions. Utilizing such "big data," we conducted research
   using factors that enable freelancers to win employment contests. The
   contest is one of the most popular mechanisms of freelancer selection,
   implying an open competition between all the candidates who perform the
   task set up by the competition organizer who finally determines a winner
   and pays a remuneration. The study uses open data on contests held from
   November 2009 to November 2018 on the largest Russian-language online
   marketplace. Data were collected automatically using a web scraping
   technique. The final sample consists of 6,169 contests, in which 335,613
   freelancers took part, and the number of unique participants was 45,174
   persons. The study results indicate the absence of persistent
   discrimination on the basis of socio-demographic characteristics. The
   results also revealed the important role of formalized reputation
   (embodied in ratings and reviews) and communication between the
   freelancer and the employer (in the form of mutual comments) that
   increase the chances of a freelancer winning a contest. The paper also
   discusses methodological issues that arise when working with "big data."
   In general, this study of contests on freelance online marketplaces
   leads to the understanding of the role of social factors in the
   functioning of the new electronic economy based on "big data" generated
   by this economy.

AB As a public health measure against COVID-19, South Africa restricted the
   sale of "tobacco, e-cigarettes and related products" for 5 months,
   ending on August 17, 2020. We examined marketing activities related to
   novel tobacco products (e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products) during
   this restriction. Using web scraping, we accessed data for 2661
   e-cigarette liquids marketed online by South African vendors in June
   2020. We also analyzed heated tobacco product volume sales (kits) using
   retail scanner data from Nielsen Company. The 2661 e-cigarette liquids
   assessed online comprised cannabidiol liquids, 28.8%[767/2661], nicotine
   salts, 10.4%[276/ 2661], e-cigarette juice concentrates,
   14.1%[376/2661], nicotine-free e-liquid, 4.0%[107/2661], and
   nicotinecontaining e-liquid, 42.6%[1135/2661]. Cannabidiol liquids had
   the highest percentage of fruit (78.4%[601/ 767]) and tobacco flavors
   (9.4%[72/767]). During the restriction, many online e-cigarette vendors
   actively promoted cannabidiol liquid in lieu of regular e-liquid.
   Nielsen retail scanner data showed that volume of heated tobacco product
   sales in February 2020, preceding the restriction (7.76 million kits),
   were higher than in February 2019 (4.52 million kits). The restriction
   saw decreased sales of heated tobacco products; mean weekly heated
   tobacco product sales in the 6 weeks following the restriction (772,585
   kits/week) were dramatically lower versus the 6 weeks preceding the
   restriction (2.26 million kits/week). Lifting the restriction saw a 131%
   spike in sales between the latter half of August 2020 (825,638 kits) and
   mid-September 2020 sales (1.90 million kits), even though total sales in
   September 2020 were half of what was observed in the preceding year
   (3.81 million units in September 2020, vs 6.33 million units, September
   2019). The marketing of cannabidiol and other novel products by
   e-cigarette manufacturers and the tobacco industry may encourage youth
   use; close monitoring is required.

AB Short-term rentals such as Airbnb have become a persistent element of
   today's urbanism around the globe. The impacts are manifold and differ
   depending on the context. In cities with a traditionally smaller
   accommodation market, the impacts might be particularly strong, as
   Airbnb contributes to ongoing touristification processes. Despite that,
   small and medium-sized cities have not been in the centre of research so
   far. This paper focuses on Santa Cruz de Tenerife as a medium-sized
   Spanish city. Although embedded in the touristic region of the Canary
   Islands, Santa Cruz is not a tourist city per se but still relies on
   touristification strategies. This paper aims to expand the knowledge of
   Airbnb's spatial patterns in this type of city. The use of data
   collected from web scraping and geographic information systems (GIS)
   demonstrates that Airbnb has opened up new tourism markets outside of
   the centrally established tourist accommodations. It also shows that the
   price gap between Airbnb and the housing rental market is broadest in
   neighbourhoods that had not experienced tourism before Airbnb entered
   the market. In the centre the highest prices and the smallest units are
   identified, but two peripheral quarters stand out. Anaga Mountains, a
   natural and rural space, has the highest numbers of Airbnb listings per
   capita. Suroeste, a suburban quarter, shows the highest growth rates on
   the rental market, which implies a linkage between Airbnb and
   suburbanization processes.

AB In this paper, we investigate the economic effects of deregulation in
   Japan's intercity coach industry. Specifically, we examine the intensity
   of competition in the industry using a unique dataset, to evaluate the
   economic effects of two major deregulations in 2002 and 2013. The
   absence of organized data means there is no previous research that
   quantitatively evaluates the deregulations. We collect data capturing
   the entry of bus operating companies by web-scraping and use a
   structural estimation method developed in econometrics for the purpose
   of measuring the degree of competition. Our em-pirical analysis yields
   the following three main results. First, we find that the markup ratios
   always exceed 1, which indicates that the entry of one additional firm
   always intensifies competition. Specifically, the markup gained by one
   firm under duopoly is estimated to be about three quarters of that under
   monopoly. Second, the competitive effect of an additional entry
   decreases as the number of incumbents increases. This result is obtained
   irrespective of the mode of competition. Third, we find that the
   services offered by firms in the industry are significantly
   differentiated. Counterfactual analysis reveals that additional 0.76
   firms can enter a market on average by differentiating their products
   from each other. These results provide useful insights into the
   development of competition policy pertaining to the contemporary
   transportation industry.

AB Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is perhaps the
   greatest global health challenge of the last century. Accompanying this
   pandemic is a parallel "infodemic," including the online marketing and
   sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products
   including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable "cures."
   Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of
   internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms
   that now have billions of global users.
   Objective: This study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable
   reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved
   COVID-19-related health care products from Twitter and Instagram.
   Methods: This study is conducted in two phases beginning with the
   collection of COVID-19-related Twitter and Instagram posts using a
   combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public
   streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords
   associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The
   second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing
   (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then
   manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized
   illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public
   health intelligence.
   Results: We collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram
   posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of
   COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to
   May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches,
   we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with
   questionable sales of COVID-19-related products. Generally, product
   introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of
   questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect
   testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have
   not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected
   included products offered in different languages, various claims of
   product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved
   testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods.
   Conclusions: Results from this study provide initial insight into one
   front of the "infodemic" fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what
   types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were
   active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the
   pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the
   pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and
   treatment. This data intelligence can help public health agencies,
   regulatory authorities, legitimate manufacturers, and technology
   platforms better remove and prevent this content from harming the
   public.

AB The paper follows-up ongoing research focusing on the potential of
   machine-readable data as additional knowledge in the governance of local
   tourism and destination management organizations (DMOs) in Slovakia. The
   current focus is on one classic social media (Facebook), one
   location-based social media (Foursquare), two hybrid travel-related
   platforms with partial attributes of reservation services (Google
   Places, TripAdvisor), and two online reservation services (Booking,
   Airbnb). The global aim is the usage of extracted data for the
   identification of additional entities with the obligation of local
   occupancy taxation, which is the financial backbone of Slovak (DMOs). A
   set of simple and globally reusable scripts constructed in Python and
   PostgreSQL were used to extract data on lodging providers from the
   Google Places application programming interface (API), the Facebook
   Place Search API and the Foursquare Venue API over grid overlays of
   districts' spatial representation. For pure scientific purposes in the
   case of Tripadvisor, Booking, and Airbnb, with no suitable access to
   open APIs, web scraping methods were used for data extraction. The pilot
   case was applied in the boundaries of Kosice city (Slovakia), and the
   aggregations of processed data were compared with official open
   statistics. Results indicate that the automated continuous monitoring of
   online platforms could help local public administrations in decreasing
   occupancy tax evasions and even widen knowledge about online audiences
   and visitors' satisfaction.

AB Organizational scientists must capitalize on the big data revolution to
   better understand the nomothetic, idiographic, multilevel, and/or
   dynamic processes that make up today's workplace. Simultaneously,
   researchers must collect high-quality data and be careful, diligent, and
   deliberate during data wrangling and data analysis so that all results
   can be replicated and all inferences are appropriate. Unfortunately, big
   data create many uncommon challenges during data acquisition and data
   wrangling that must be considered and overcome to fulfill the promise
   and potential of big data. Specifically, during acquisition,
   organizational scientists must become familiar with concepts like web
   scraping and databases, determine how to divide big data files into
   manageable chunks for cleaning and analysis, all while ensuring not to
   violate data usage rules and regulations. Likewise, once acquired, to
   effectively wrangle data so that they are ready for analysis researchers
   must be able to handle multiple file formats and data encoding
   standards, utilize a variety of software to visualize and diagnose data
   structure, and be adept at using functions and algorithms to determine
   variable structure and evaluate records and variables for missing or
   erroneous information. The current article provides a concise definition
   of big data and addresses each of these novel challenges and concepts
   related to big data acquisition and wrangling, specifically focusing on
   providing guidance and recommendations. Finally, a detailed big data
   example, team development using play-by-play basketball data, is
   provided. Each step of the process of scraping the data from the web as
   well as wrangling the multilevel big data into tidy data form is
   discussed, accompanied by a supplemental R file that contains all of the
   code necessary for researchers to replicate the described procedure.

AB Purpose The paper aims to propose a knowledge visualization approach and
   algorithm to support public decision makers to define the inner areas,
   which represents a strategic topic in the European debate about
   territorial inequality and development. Design/methodology/approach The
   study has been developed by following the design science research, which
   includes six steps: problem identification and motivation;
   identification of the objectives for a solution; design and development;
   demonstration; evaluation; and communication. As for the design and
   development step, the proposed approach and algorithm ground on
   association mining to discover hidden relationships existing among
   municipalities. They have been applied to analyse the 97 municipalities
   of the Lecce province, and each municipality has been described through
   30 multi-domain indicators organized into seven categories, whose data
   have been collected from institutional datasets, local sources or
   web-scraping process. Findings A set of complementary analyses has been
   generated through the construction of dynamic and interactive knowledge
   maps that show "similar" municipalities according to the indicators
   selected. Originality/value The approach and algorithm proposed allow
   discovering similarities existing among distinct municipalities, based
   on the analysis of a set of multi-domain indicators. The approach may
   complement or completely substitute the existing ones used to define
   inner areas, thus overcoming both the methodological limits of the
   "top-down" line imposed by the central legislator, and the "bottom-up"
   paradox consisting in the illusion that single (and often small) towns
   have the economic and cognitive resources necessary to implement
   effective territorial mapping and development strategies. In such a way,
   policy makers can be aware on similarities existing among distinct towns
   and can thus share cognitive and financial resources to define a common
   plan and a set of practices for territorial development.

AB Online food delivery (OFD) platforms have changed how consumers purchase
   food prepared outside of home by capitalising on convenience and
   smartphone technology. Independent food outlets encompass a substantial
   proportion of partnering outlets, but their offerings' nutritional
   quality is understudied. Little is also known as to how OFD platforms
   influence consumer choice. This study evaluated the nutritional quality
   and marketing attributes of offerings from independent takeaway outlets
   available on Sydney's market-leading OFD platform (UberEats(R)).
   Complete menus and marketing attributes from 202 popular outlets were
   collected using web scraping. All 13841 menu items were classified into
   38 food and beverage categories based on the Australian Dietary
   Guidelines. Of complete menus, 80.5% (11,139/13,841) were discretionary
   and 42.3% (5849/13,841) were discretionary cereal-based mixed meals, the
   largest of the 38 categories. Discretionary menu items were more likely
   to be categorised as most popular (OR: 2.5, 95% CI 1.9-3.2), accompanied
   by an image (OR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) and offered as a value bundle (OR:
   6.5, 95% CI 4.8-8.9). Two of the three discretionary food categories
   were more expensive than their healthier Five Food Group counterparts (p
   < 0.02). The ubiquity of discretionary choices offered by independent
   takeaways and the marketing attributes employed by OFD platforms has
   implications for public health policy. Further research on the
   contribution of discretionary choices and marketing attributes to
   nutritional intakes is warranted.

AB The importance of data and evidence has increased considerably in policy
   planning, implementation, and evaluation. There is unprecedented
   availability of open and big data, and there are rapid developments in
   intelligence gathering and the application of analytical tools. While
   cultural heritage holds many tangible and intangible values for local
   communities and society in general, there is a knowledge gap regarding
   suitable methods and data sources to measure the impacts and develop
   data-driven policies of cultural tourism. In the tourism sector, rapid
   developments are particularly taking place around novel uses of mobile
   positioning data, web scraping, and open application programming
   interface (API) data, data on sharing, and collaborative economy and
   passenger data. Based on feedback from 15 European cultural tourism
   regions, recommendations are developed regarding the use of innovative
   tools and data sources in tourism management. In terms of potential
   analytical depth, it is especially advisable to explore the use of
   mobile positioning data. Yet, there are considerable barriers,
   especially in terms of privacy protection and ethics, in using such
   data. User-generated big data from social media, web searches, and
   website visits constitute another promising data source as it is often
   publicly available in real time and has low usage barriers. Due to the

AB Online communication in professional networks has become an essential
   part of daily scientific practice. As such, there is a real need for
   social reflection regarding the phenomenon of academic leadership and
   academic network interaction, and for an empirical investigation of such
   virtual communities based on verified and generalized data. This paper
   presents the results of research aimed at studying the interrelations of
   scientists' network communications in virtual communities using the
   example of ResearchGate (RG) and their real life professional
   achievements. The goals of the study are to reconstruct the spectrum of
   communication practices of RG users, recreate its 'strategic landscape'
   and define the influence of institutional factors and demographic
   characteristics on the users' network activity. To meet these
   objectives, empirical research is conducted using a Web Scraping
   approach; the significant array of data is acquired using a computerized
   method ('web crawler'). The sample consists of 4800 profiles with quotas
   of 200 profiles for each of the 24 spheres of science represented in RG.
   Cluster analysis of the data reveals three clusters of RG users
   depending on their communicative practices. It is revealed that neither
   age nor status influence the network activity. At the same time, ranking
   the institutional affiliation of the users, according to the ARWU
   university ranking system, demonstrated the influence of institutional
   factors on their network behaviour. Scientific communication in social
   media turns out to be relevant to modern research practices. Those
   scientists who do not use the benefits of communication interactions
   will have little claim on the role of academic leader. The verified
   results of our research essentially contribute to the understanding of
   how a scientist should use the advantages of the network in his/her
   professional activity, and how to overcome institutional limits which
   inhibit academic advancement.

AB This data article describes a panel dataset that combines flexible
   office space market data with entrepreneurial data, such as founding and
   funding of ventures in 47 European cities. One adaption of new ways of
   working are coworking spaces. They are shared working environments that
   offer office space and intangible resources, such as knowledge sharing,
   collaboration and networking. Access to flexible office space for
   self-employed, start-ups, and corporates is a key resource for
   businesses. Covid-19 has shown that space provision is becoming more
   flexible and ventures increasingly use scalable space instead of
   long-term lease agreements for office space or than owning it. Deskmag
   counts 18,700 coworking spaces worldwide in the year of 2018 with 1.65
   million coworkers and high future growth expectations after COVID-19
   [1]. Data were collected through two sources. Data about coworking
   spaces were collected through a web scraper crawling for coworking
   spaces within a city as of December 31, 2018. Those data were manually
   enriched by real estate and economic variables, such as the office high
   prime rent and office market size. Data about the funding and founding
   of ven-tures were obtained through using the database Crunchbase,
   including all start-ups in a city with their type of funding (including:
   seed, venture capital, private equity, debt convertibles and others) and
   their financing rounds. The Crunchbase database lists mostly young
   firms, commonly called startups and small medium enterprises (SME), and
   their financing with external funding. It includes firms that have
   needed or might need funding in the near future, or have already got
   funding. Hence, it is possible to relate spatial clusters with
   entrepreneurial activity and analyze for example the influence of
   (flexible) office markets on founding activity. This dataset enables
   researchers and practitioners to further explore important questions
   regarding the nexus between the real estate industry, entrepreneurship
   behavior, start-ups and regional clusters. Due to the scarcity of
   publicly available quality flexible office space market data, the
   dataset detailed in this article may play a relevant role to be ready to
   be used by researchers and practitioners. Funding data can be used for
   regional analysis, growth development, or any other economic issues. (C)

AB The present research contributed to the growing body of research
   regarding the use of emoji in sensory and consumer research by filling
   an acknowledged knowledge gap. Its specific aim was to explore the
   meaning of emoji in a food-related context. The empirical approach
   involved 357 consumers who were tasked with writing a social media post
   or text message relating to a situation involving eating/drinking which
   was to be centered around a specific emoji. A total of 21 facial emoji
   were included in the research. As expected, emoji were used to convey
   different meanings, including degree of liking/disliking, emotional
   associations, gestures and expressions. The emoji were also used as part
   of messages describing negative and positive disconfirmation of
   expectations, which points to the importance of measuring expectations
   in a food-related context. Two emoji were identified as unsuitable for
   future research due to their nonconsensual meaning ( and ).
   Practical Applications Emoji have significant potential as a research
   tool, stretching beyond cross-cultural research or studies involving
   children, to general applications in food-related consumer research.
   This is further enhanced by their versatility which includes use in
   emotion questionnaires, open-ended questions and web-scraped content.
   The present research provides recommendations for the design of emoji
   questionnaires, as well as insights on emoji meanings in a food-related
   context. Results also highlight the relevance of negative and positive
   disconfirmation of expectations in shaping emotional associations with
   eating/drinking experiences, and, as such, serve as a reminder to
   include these important determinants of consumer behavior in future
   emotion-focused research.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe a new method to improve
   the analysis of search engine results by considering the provider level
   as well as the domain level. This approach is tested by conducting a
   study using queries on the topic of insurance comparisons.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an empirical study
   that analyses the results of search queries aimed at comparing insurance
   companies. The authors used a self-developed software system that
   automatically queries commercial search engines and automatically
   extracts the content of the returned result pages for further data
   analysis. The data analysis was carried out using the KNIME Analytics
   Platform. Findings Google's top search results are served by only a few
   providers that frequently appear in these results. The authors show that
   some providers operate several domains on the same topic and that these
   domains appear for the same queries in the result lists.
   Originality/value The proposed method allows large-scale analysis of the
   composition of the top results from commercial search engines. It allows
   using valid empirical data to determine what users actually see on the
   search engine result pages.

AB The Internet is ever growing and the information is highly unstructured.
   Finding the best priced product when shopping online is a difficult
   task, but shopping search engines help the user identify the desired
   product. Starting from this reality, this paper presents a distributed
   framework for information retrieval, processing and presentation of
   data, which has three main components: a data server cluster, a
   distributed crawler with a product extraction feature, and a web server
   for presenting the processed data. The considered use case consists of
   extracting information about board and card games from specialized
   websites and presenting the data in a user-friendly website. Efficiency
   is determined by means of performance evaluation metrics that include
   crawl and extraction times, and a discussion in terms of scalability.
   The high modularization of the framework allows it to be an effective
   teaching tool in classrooms; each module can be easily swapped with a
   custom implementation. The proposed framework offers students and
   researchers an environment for developing and testing a wide range of
   algorithms and programming solutions, e.g., load balancer, crawler,
   reverse engineering a web template, product extractor from web pages,
   data normalization, notification services, web APIs, custom database.

AB Purpose Wine has been produced for thousands of years and nowadays we
   have seen a spread in the wine culture. E-commerce sales of wine have
   increased considerably and online customer's satisfaction is influenced
   by quality and price. This paper presents a case study of the company
   "QuieroVinos, S.L.", an online wine shop founded in 2015 that sells
   Spanish wines in two main marketplaces. Design/methodology/approach With
   the final target of increasing the company profits it has been designed
   and developed an application to track the prices of competitors for a
   set of products. This information will be used to set the product prices
   in order to offer the products both competitively and profitably in each
   Marketplace. This application must check, by tacking into account
   information such as the product cost or the minimum product margin, if
   it is possible to decrease the price in order to reach the top cheapest
   position and as a consequence, increase the sales. Findings The
   application improved in a notorious way the company's results in terms
   of sales and shipping costs. It must be said that without the use of the
   presented application, performing the price comparison process within
   each one of the marketplaces would have taken a long time. Moreover, as
   prices change very frequently, the obtained information has a very
   limited time value, and the competitors prices should be analyzed daily
   in order to take accurate decisions regarding the company's price
   policy. Originality/value Although the application has been designed for
   the wine sector and the two named marketplace, it could be exported to
   other sectors. For that, it should be implemented new modules to collect
   information regarding the competitor's price of the products selling on
   each corresponding marketplace.

AB In logistics, questions as "Where is my container?" and "When does my
   container arrive?" can often not be answered with sufficient precision,
   which restricts the ability of logistics service providers to be
   efficient. Since logistics is complex and often involves multiple
   transportation modes and carriers, improving efficiency and saving costs
   in the supply chain requires communication between the different parties
   and the usage of real-time data is critical. Currently, logistics
   service providers (LSPs) use real-time data to a very limited extent,
   mainly for tracking the progress of a specific part of a given shipment.
   This data is retrieved manually from a number of websites and sharing
   with other actors is not even considered. This leads to lack of end-to
   end visibility and delays in planning. This research proposes an
   architecture and a common data model for an integration platform that
   allows the automated collection of real time container tracking data
   enabling LSPs to plan more efficient. Currently, there is no common data
   model available that contains all the information required and enables
   LSPs to track their shipments real-time. The common data model is
   designed via a bottom-up approach using results of interviews,
   observations at different logistics service providers, analyses of open
   data on websites, and serves the information needs of the business
   processes involving such data. The model is also validated against
   industry standards. Based on the proposed architecture a prototype was
   built that is tested in real operating conditions with a fourth party
   logistics company.

AB Objectives Traditional methods for creating food composition tables
   struggle to cope with the large number of products and the rapid pace of
   change in the food and drink marketplace. This paper introduces foodDB,
   a big data approach to the analysis of this marketplace, and presents
   analyses illustrating its research potential.
   Design foodDB has been used to collect data weekly on all foods and
   drinks available on six major UK supermarket websites since November
   2017. As of June 2018, foodDB has 3 193 171 observations of 128 283
   distinct food and drink products measured at multiple timepoints.
   Methods Weekly extraction of nutrition and availability data of products
   was extracted from the webpages of the supermarket websites. This
   process was automated with a codebase written in Python.
   Results Analyses using a single weekly timepoint of 97 368 total
   products in March 2018 identified 2699 ready meals and pizzas, and
   showed that lower price ready meals had significantly lower levels of
   fat, saturates, sugar and salt (p<0.001). Longitudinal analyses of 903
   pizzas revealed that 10.8% changed their nutritional formulation over 6
   months, and 29.9% were either discontinued or new market entries.
   Conclusions foodDB is a powerful new tool for monitoring the food and
   drink marketplace, the comprehensive sampling and granularity of
   collection provides power for revealing analyses of the relationship
   between nutritional quality and marketing of branded foods, timely
   observation of product reformulation and other changes to the food
   marketplace.

AB E-commerce intelligent applications require the analysis and mining of
   large volumes of transaction data to support business managers in making
   informed decisions. In this paper, we describe a scalable data
   warehousing and OLAP-based engine for analyzing customer log and buying
   records to target marketing and guide personalized marketing. The
   important component of the engine is Customer Profiling Data Cube, which
   aims to extract patterns of buying from a collection of transaction
   customer records, and the comparison of buying patterns for analysis and
   getting rules for decision-maker. A new data model of Web Mining Engine
   for Web data is introduced to analyze customer behavior. The merit of
   the cube model is that it not only aggregates customer access
   information but also takes the Web structure information into account.
   Based on the model, we propose some solutions to intelligently discover
   interesting customer access patterns for Website optimization. We used
   Web usage data from an E-commerce Website in China to evaluate the
   effectiveness of this Web Mining Engine. The results show that this
   engine is effective and efficient to apply into practical E-commerce
   applications.

AB There are three important web mining operations, which are similar to
   traditional data mining i.e. clustering, association and sequential
   analysis. But there are some important differences between clustering in
   traditional applications and clustering in web mining, e.g. the clusters
   and associations in web mining do not necessarily have crisp boundaries.
   Also due to reasons inherent in web browsing and web logging, the higher
   incomplete data existing in web mining is another difference. Therefore,
   in this paper we firstly clarify some concepts such as data source, data
   categories and user profile. Then an approach is proposed to infer the
   user profile and rules for customized marketing on the web. It
   integrates clustering and association rules for the inference. Because
   most previous techniques such as induction learning perform individual
   based inference for customized marketing, so that some difficulties
   occur while it costs more to learn the personal preferences. In order to
   avoid those troubles, we use association rules instead. In the end of
   this paper an experiment is carried out to collect data for performance
   evaluation. The experimental results show that the integrated approach
   increases the degree of support and confidence, and can produce more
   precise rules.

AB The Web is becoming the apocryphal Vox Populi. There is an ever
   expanding amount of information "out there". Unfortunately, the morass
   of sources presents a formidable hurdle to effectively extract
   information from them. Web Mining consists of extracting knowledge from
   huge volumes of data available in WWW and other web sources, allowing
   better business decisions to be taken. Web Mining has been coined from
   Information Management & Retrieval (IM&R) and Artificial Intelligence
   (AI). In thus paper, it has been shown how web mining is integrated to
   the knowledge discovery process, its potential applications, and
   techniques. Furthermore, an integrated architecture has been presented
   showing how web mining can contribute to e-business via the new
   technologies. Finally, some commercially-available architecture has been
   presented.

   provided by the Internet Merchants causes the problem of information
   overload and this will reduces the customer's satisfaction and

   mining is proposed in this paper. The system utilized a variety of data
   mining techniques such as web usage mining, association rule mining etc.
   Based on these techniques, the system can trace the customer's shopping
   behavior and learn his/her up-to-date preferences adaptively. The
   experiments have been conducted to evaluate its recommender quality and
   the results show that the system can give sensible recommendations, and
   is able to help customers save enormous time for Internet shopping.

AB Conventional Web mining models for web log almost only consider the
   distance between pages and ignore the structure of a Web site, so they
   can't do data mining accurately. For a Web site framework, almost Web
   pages near to the homepage are navigating pages and those far, from
   homepage are content pages. For analyzing the navigating pages, access
   times is more dominant, while for analyzing content pages, access time
   length is more dominant. A new Web mining model for user frequent
   navigation pattern is issued, which considers the Web site framework
   adequately. It is proved that the model figures out the shortages of
   conventional Web mining models for user frequent navigation pattern by
   experimentations. It can be used to improve E-business Web site
   framework and efficiency of the Web site system to make users more
   satisfactory.

AB This paper is concerned with proposing the fuzzy cognitive map
   (FCM)-driven inference amplification mechanism in the field of
   web-mining. As the recent advent of the Internet, most of the modern
   firms are now geared towards using the web technology in their daily as
   well as strategic activities. The web-mining technology provides theta
   with unprecedented ability to analyze web-log data, which are seemingly
   full of useful information, but often lack of important and meaningful
   information. This indicates the need to develop an advanced inference
   mechanism extracting richer implication from the web-mining results. In
   this sense, we propose a new web-mining inference amplification (WEMIA)
   mechanism using the inference logic of FCM. The association rule mining
   is what we adopt as the web-mining technique to prove the validity of
   the proposed WEMIA. The main recipe of the proposed WEMIA is the
   three-phased inference amplification. The first phase is to apply the
   association rule mining, and the second phase is to transform the
   association rules into FCM-driven causal knowledge bases. The third
   phase is dedicated to amplifying the inference by developing the causal
   knowledge-based inference equivalence property, which was derived from
   analyzing the inference mechanism of FCMs. With an illustrative web-log
   database, we suggest results proving the robustness of our proposed
   WEMIA mechanism. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two important and interesting areas of current research are data mining
   and the World Wide Web. The combination of the two areas is referred to
   as web mining. Generally, web mining has been separated into two
   distinct methods. The first is web content mining, which describes the
   process of information retrieval and extraction from varieties of
   sources across the World Wide Web. The second is Web usage mining, which
   is the process of mining web access patterns or other user information
   on one or more Web localities. In this paper we discuss Web mining,
   including the various research issues, techniques and tools, and
   development efforts in Web content mining and Web usage mining.

AB Quality assurance (QA) of pharmaceutical warehouses is a critical issue
   for formulating working instructions in accord with many regulations.
   Currently, such QA planning, relying on human experience, not only
   increases the chance of errors and quality problems for pharmaceutical
   products, but also results in high rejection and recall rates. This
   paper proposes a web mining-based quality assurance system (WMQAS),
   integrating case-based reasoning (CBR) and a hybrid web mining
   technique, to facilitate decision-making in QA operations in
   pharmaceutical warehouses. CBR is applied for solving complex new
   problems based on past cases, however, current case adaptation processes
   are mainly based on the experience of expert where past solutions are
   modified. The proposed system embeds a hybrid web mining technique in
   the case adaptation engine to extract the useful web information for
   decision-makers. Consequently, the effectiveness and efficiency of QA
   processes can be enhanced, and the product quality can be maintained.

   in order to create innovation indicators of Canadian nanotechnology and
   advanced materials firms. 79 websites were extracted and analysed based
   on keywords related to the concepts of R&D and intellectual property. To
   understand what our web mining indicators actually measure, we compare
   them with those from a classic questionnaire-based survey. Formative
   indices from the surveys variables were built to better represent all
   the possibilities resulting from the web mining indicators. A MTMM
   matrix lead us to conclude that the formative indices are a good
   representation of the web mining indicators. As a consequence, the data
   extracted via our web mining technique can be used as proxies for the
   relative importance of R&D and the importance of IP, which would have
   previously only been measured using conventional methods such as
   government administrative data or questionnaire-based surveys.

AB A variety of the web-mining techniques are now being extensively
   utilized to extract useful knowledge about customer behaviors on the
   Internet. However, the naive interpretation of the web-mining results
   would lead to poor decision on customer behaviors, which is likely to
   cause waste of time and efforts on managing electronic commerce
   strategy. To overcome this pitfall, this study proposes using the
   cognitive map-based interpretation of the web-mining results.
   Conventional approach to obtaining the web-mining results is based on
   the association rule approach (ARA), while the cognitive map approach
   (CMA) is believed to provide more robust support in interpreting the
   web-mining results. Therefore, to compare the interpretation capability
   of the two approaches, the four constructs such as perceived usefulness,
   causality, information richness, users' attitude and intention to use
   the approaches are adopted in the research model and tested against the
   questionnaire data. The test results obtained through applying the
   structural equation models reveal that CMA is comparable to ARA and the
   cognitive map has a great potential in helping enrich the interpretation
   of the web mining results and build more effective Internet business
   strategy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The internet is a valuable source of information where many ideas can be
   found dealing with different topics. A few numbers of ideas might be
   able to solve an existing problem. However, it is time-consuming to
   identify these ideas within the large amount of textual information in
   the internet. This paper introduces a new web mining approach that
   enables an automated identification of new technological ideas extracted
   from internet sources that are able to solve a given problem. It adapts
   and combines several existing approaches from literature: approaches
   that extract new technological ideas from a user given text, approaches
   that investigate the different idea characteristics in different
   technical domains, and multi-language web mining approaches. In contrast
   to previous work, the proposed approach enables the identification of
   problem solution ideas in the internet considering domain dependencies
   and language aspects. In a case study, new ideas are identified to solve
   existing technological problems as occurred in research and development
   (R&D) projects. This supports the process of research planning and

AB Recently, the privacy and security of big data has become an important
   challenge, which requires the privacy preserving data mining techniques
   to maintain the trade-off between the data utility and privacy. Web
   mining is the application of data mining techniques for mining the web
   data. Privacy issues on the web are based on the fact that most users
   want to maintain a strict anonymity on web applications and activities.
   Various conventional techniques are used for privacy preservation like
   condensation, randomization and tree structure etc. The limitations of
   the existing approaches are maintaining a balance between the data
   utility and privacy and the scalability problem. The data stream can be
   secured and classified by privacy preserving techniques such as
   perturbation, cryptography and machine learning techniques, etc. Here
   the machine learning technique Naive Bayes is employed to classify the
   perturbed data streams and provides an efficient accuracy. In this
   proposed research work, the UCI web mining datasets arc collected,
   clustering is done with the help of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Flip and
   Rotation Perturbation (FRP) technique is applied to perform data
   renovation and classification on perturbed data is done using Naive
   Bayes classifier. The classifier is improved by using a holdout approach
   on data separation in training and testing phases. The classification
   accuracy, computation time, and error rate of the classifier are
   measured and they are compared with the ones of the existing method. The
   comparison shows the achieved result of the proposed method. This
   proposed system is done with the help of MATLAB 2018a.

AB Web mining is a concept that gathers all techniques, methods and
   algorithms used to extract information and knowledge from data
   originating on the web (web data). A part of this technique aims to
   analyze the behavior of users in order to continuously improve both the
   structure and content of visited web sites. Behind this quite altruistic
   belief - namely, to help the user feel comfortable when they visit a
   site through a personalization process - there underlie a series of
   processing methodologies which operate at least arguably from the point
   of view of the users' privacy.
   Thus, an important question arises; to what extent may the desire to
   improve the services offered through a web site infringe upon the
   privacy of those who visit it? The use of powerful processing tools such
   as those provided by web mining may threaten users' privacy.
   Current legal scholarship on privacy issues suggests a flexible approach
   that enables the determination, within each particular context, of those
   behaviors that can threaten individual privacy. However, it has been
   observed that TIC professionals, with the purpose of formulating
   practical rules on this matter, have a very narrow-minded concept of
   privacy, primarily centered on the dichotomy between personal
   identifiable information (PII) and anonymous data.
   The aim of this paper is to adopt an integrative approach based on the
   distinctive attributes of web mining in order to determine which
   techniques and uses are harmful. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   from huge volumes of data available in WWW and other Web sources,
   allowing better business decisions to be taken. These Web Mining methods
   include content journaling, script parsing, server monitoring, network

   referred to as transliteration. In this research we propose a generic
   transliteration framework, which incorporates an enhanced Hidden Markov
   Model (HMM) and a Web mining model. We improved the traditional
   statistical-based transliteration in three areas: (1) incorporated a
   simple phonetic transliteration knowledge base; (2) incorporated a
   bigram and a trigram HMM; ( 3) incorporated a Web mining model that uses
   word frequency of occurrence information from the Web. We evaluated the
   framework on an English-Arabic back transliteration. Experiments showed
   that when using HMM alone, a combination of the bigram and trigram HMM
   approach performed the best for English-Arabic transliteration. While
   the bigram model alone achieved fairly good performance, the trigram
   model alone did not. The Web mining approach boosted the performance by
   79.05%. Overall, our framework achieved a precision of 0.72 when the
   eight best transliterations were considered. Our results show promise
   for using transliteration techniques to improve multilingual Web
   retrieval.

AB Determining the size of the World Wide Web is extremely difficult. The
   Web can be viewed as the largest data source available and presents a
   challenging task for effective design and access. One proposed Web
   mining approach to handling the problem of effective design and access
   is personalization. With personalization, Web access or the contents of
   a Web page are modified to better fit the desires of the user. This may
   involve dynamically creating Web pages that are unique per user or using
   the desires of a user to determine what Web documents to retrieve. This
   paper presents a Web mining model based on dynamic clustering and hidden
   Markov model. The output of the model is some information for
   dynamically creating a web page which can best meet the user's desires.
   The assumption of the dynamic clustering is that if a group of users who
   have the same interest trend, those pages they have visited are probably
   related. We propose that human should be the authority to judge the
   correlation of two pages. First, the model statistic a user's web
   browsing records in the log file; find a group of users who have the
   same interest trend with the user; collect all the pages in which this
   group of users are interested; calculate the correlation between pages;
   and cluster the pages into several categories according to a
   predetermined threshold. Each web page category is considered as a
   stochastic state variable. In the second phase, our model based on
   hidden Markov model is further constructed to mine the latent desires of
   a user given an observed sequence of Web pages that the user have
   browsed. In order to get the optimal parameters (transition probability
   matrix, the conditional probability and the initial state) in the model,
   we applied the Baum-Welch parameter estimation method in EM algorithm to
   train the model on the data set. Experimental results show that the
   model is practicable and efficient.

AB The gastronomy industry plays an important role in the economy of many
   countries. This is especially true for Switzerland, where the gastronomy
   industry accounts for a large share of all jobs in small and medium
   enterprises. However, restaurants are facing tough challenges because of
   the recent economic turmoil. Despite their importance for the economic
   growth, limited attention has been paid to predicting restaurant growth.
   In this study, we propose the use of web mining techniques for
   restaurant growth prediction as a novel approach. Web mining enables
   automatic and large-scale collection and analysis of potentially
   valuable data from various online platforms, thus bearing a great
   potential for growth prediction. First, a systematic literature review
   on growth factors is conducted, which serves as a base to collect
   growth-relevant information from the web. Next, web mining methods are
   applied to automatically collect and extract growth factors from various
   web data sources. Finally, we build and compare different binary
   classification models using supervised machine learning algorithms. More
   specifically, the developed models classify a restaurant either in a
   non-growing or growing restaurant. The algorithms for predictive
   modeling include logistic regressions, random forests and artificial
   neural networks. Results show that random forests on web data outperform
   both logistic regressions and artificial neural networks and therefore
   are recommended for further investigations on predictive modeling of
   restaurant growth.

AB Here we introduce a web mining approach for automatically identifying
   new product ideas extracted from web logs. A web log - also known as
   blog - is a web site that provides commentary, news, and further
   information on a subject written by individual persons. We can find a
   large amount of web logs for nearly each topic where consumers present
   their needs for new products. These new product ideas probably are
   valuable for producers as well as for researchers and developers. This
   is because they can lead to a new product development process. Finding
   these new product ideas is a well-known task in marketing. Therefore,
   with this automatic approach we support marketing activities by
   extracting new and useful product ideas from textual information in
   internet logs. This approach is implemented by a web-based application
   named Product Idea Web Log Miner where users from the marketing
   department provide descriptions of existing products. As a result, new
   product ideas are extracted from the web logs and presented to the
   users.

AB In the light of digitalization and recent EU policy initiatives,
   information is an important asset that organizations of all sizes and
   from all sectors should secure. However, in order to provide common
   requirements for the implementation of an information security
   management system, the internationally well-accepted ISO/IEC 27001
   standard has not shown the expected growth rate since its publication
   more than a decade ago. In this article, we apply web mining to explore
   the adoption of ISO/IEC 27001 through a series of 2664 out of more than
   900 000 German firms from the Mannheim Enterprise Panel dataset that
   refers to this standard on their websites. As a result, we present a
   ''landscape'' of ISO/IEC 27001 in Germany, which shows that firms not
   only seek certifications themselves but often refer on their websites to
   partners who are certified instead. Consequently, we estimate a probit
   model and find that larger and more innovative firms are more likely to
   be certified to ISO/IEC 27001 and that almost half of all certified
   firms belong to the information and communications technology (ICT)
   service sector. Based on our findings, we derive implications for policy
   makers and management and critically assess the suitability of web
   mining to explore the adoption of management system standards.

   have a complete or "360 degrees" view of their operations and customers.
   The insight that they gain from such analyses is then used to direct,
   optimize, and automate their decision making to successfully achieve
   their organizational goals. Data, text, and web mining technologies are
   some of the key contributors to making advanced analytics possible. This
   paper aims to investigate these three mining technologies in terms of
   how they are used and the issues that are related to their effective
   implementation and management within the broader context of predictive
   or advanced analytics.
   Design/methodology/approach - A range of recently published research
   literature on business intelligence (131); predictive analytics; and
   data, text and web mining is reviewed to explore their current state,
   issues and challenges learned from their practice.
   Findings - The findings are reported in two parts. The first part
   discusses a framework for 131 using the data, text, and web mining
   technologies for advanced analytics; and the second part identifies and
   discusses the opportunities and challenges the business managers dealing
   with these technologies face for gaining competitive advantages for
   their businesses.
   Originality/value - The Study findings are intended to assist business
   managers to effectively understand the issues and emerging technologies
   behind advanced analytics implementation.

   effectively used for a matching process of context-aware mobile
   advertising systems. Although prior context-aware mobile advertising
   systems employed personalized and context sensitive approaches, they
   have mostly used simply aggregated user-side context information from
   sensors and have relied on previously prepared inference rules when
   performing match-making. There exist limitations in identifying more
   diverse variations that can happen in the real world due to the lack of
   considerations on daily human lives. As a novel solution, in this paper,
   we address a Natural Language Processing (NLP) combined web mining
   approach. Especially, we propose an Object-Activity-Location-Feedback
   (OALF) model which describes what objects are used for a specific
   activity in a specific location. Most of all, time-variant feedback
   valences were employed to estimate users' responses to the advertisement
   triggering entities (objects, activities, locations, and their
   combinations) in terms of long-term and short-term basis. The model can
   be realized with a set of web mining procedures including web crawling,
   data refinement, and sentiment analysis. In addition, we describe how
   the OALF model can be applied into context-aware mobile advertising and
   discuss its business model design issues.

AB Transductive learning involves the construction and application of
   prediction models to classify a fixed set of decision objects into
   discrete groups. It is a special case of classification analysis with
   important applications in web-mining, corporate planning and other
   areas. This paper proposes a novel transductive classifier that is based
   on the philosophy of discrete support vector machines. We formalize the
   task to estimate the class labels of decision objects as a mixed integer
   program. A memetic algorithm is developed to solve the mathematical
   program and to construct a transductive support vector machine
   classifier, respectively. Empirical experiments on synthetic and
   real-world data evidence the effectiveness of the new approach and
   demonstrate that it identifies high quality solutions in short time.
   Furthermore, the results suggest that the class predictions following
   from the memetic algorithm are significantly more accurate than the
   predictions of a CPLEX-based reference classifier. Comparisons to other
   transductive and inductive classifiers provide further support for our
   approach and suggest that it performs competitive with respect to
   several benchmarks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Internet has become integral part of day-to-day business to almost
   everybody, this result in diversified interests of customers. So as to
   catering to this intrinsic need, any E-Commerce firm to survive must be
   of cutting edge and competitive edge. The providers should not only to
   stay abreast with technologies where the life cycle of a technology is
   at its bare minimum and further dwindling They should also entertain the
   customers through inventively fine tuning the delicate parameters of
   website. This involves evaluating the usage pattern and trails of the
   customer left as a log, deriving pattern from click stream etc. However,
   the cutting edge technology applied by the big healthcare E-Commerce
   industries like private Cloud utilization (John et al., Optimization and
   Computing, 2012), web content mining enables them to attract and retain
   innumerable number of customers even during peak hours. According to the
   research carried out in this paper, there are two distinct types of
   online business based on web content promoted towards buy, they are
   classified as exhaustive promote and partial promote. Typically
   exhaustive promote website perform even complex web mining operations
   for identifying and enticing the potential customers to buy various
   healthcare products based on various factors such as buying habits,
   interests etc. However for the partial promote in the observed cases,
   they are not even aware of the existence of such techniques. Based on
   the analysis performed on various renounced online websites, if 60% and
   above of the web content leads the customer to perform the buy, then it
   is exhaustive promote the rest is considered as partial promote.
   Moreover a huge gap is observed between Partial and exhaustive promote
   when it comes to the deployment of the web mining techniques.
   Consequently to understand the varying role of web mining in the online
   business successes, this paper models the web mining as a Game in
   Cournot Model. The results show that the model suits the economics
   behind the online businesses in both the cases and thus helps to
   identify or enhance the underlying web mining techniques towards
   business success.

AB Web mining procedure helps the surfers to get the required information
   but finding the exact information is as good as finding a needle in a
   haystack. In this work, an intelligent prediction model using Tensor
   Flow environment for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) devices has been
   designed to meet the challenges of speed and accuracy. The proposed
   approach is isolated into two stages: pre-processing and prediction. In
   the first phase, the procedure starts via looking through the URLs of
   various e-learning sites particular to computer science subjects. At
   that point, the content of looked through URLs are perused and after
   that from their keywords are produced identified with a particular
   subject in the wake of playing out the pre-processing of the content.
   Second phase is prediction that predicts query specific links of
   e-learning website. The proposed Intelligent E-learning through Web
   (IEW) has content mining, lexical analysis, classification and machine
   learning based prediction as its key features. Algorithms like SVM,
   Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest were tested and it
   was found that Random Forest gave an accuracy of 98.98%, SVM 42%, KNN
   63% and Naive Bayes 66%. Based on the results IEW uses Random forest for

AB Unemployment rate is one of the most critical economic indicators. By
   analyzing and predicting unemployment rate, government officials can
   develop appropriate labor market related policies in response to the
   current economic situation. Accordingly, unemployment rate prediction
   has attracted a lot of attention from researchers in recent years. The
   main contribution of this paper is the illustration of a novel
   ontology-based Web mining framework that leverages search engine queries
   to improve the accuracy of unemployment rate prediction. The proposed
   framework is underpinned by a domain ontology which captures
   unemployment related concepts and their semantic relationships to
   facilitate the extraction of useful prediction features from relevant
   search engine queries. In addition, state-of-the-art feature selection
   methods and data mining models such as neural networks and support
   vector regressions are exploited to enhance the effectiveness of
   unemployment rate prediction. Our experimental results show that the
   proposed framework outperforms other baseline forecasting approaches
   that have been widely used for unemployment rate prediction. Our
   empirical findings also confirm that domain ontology and search engine
   queries can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of unemployment
   rate prediction. A unique advantage of the proposed framework is that it
   not only improves prediction performance but also provides human
   comprehensible explanations for the changes of unemployment rate. The
   business implication of our research work is that government officials
   and human resources managers can utilize the proposed framework to
   effectively analyze unemployment rate, and hence to better develop labor
   market related policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently there has been much interest in electronic commerce
   applications that use data mining techniques to explore datasets in the
   social media context. However, most of the applications have already
   been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate
   tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting
   high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications.
   This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for
   building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of
   the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining
   algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for
   building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework
   flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the
   construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the
   use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms.
   In order to improve the efficacy of information extraction from blogs,
   ontology is used in the blog's description. For this, there are software
   agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific
   tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for
   encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse.
   This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping
   the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog
   world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software
   architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining)
   providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework,
   which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service
   composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study
   of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user's sentiment
   regarding specific products is reported and its results considers the
   effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the
   proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well
   as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed
   application, such as the evolution impact. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   structural characteristics of more than 139,000 apartments, alongside
   their location and price. We provided our full dataset for the article,
   so that other researchers can reproduce our results or conduct further
   analyses. Using this dataset, we analyzed housing prices of Tehran in
   order to identify its major determinants. To this aim, we examine the
   dynamics of housing prices at the district levels of Tehran using
   Hedonic Price model. Our results highlight a number of points,
   including: Base area of an apartment is positively correlated with price
   per square meter (r=0.89), showing a two-folded impact on the overall
   price. Air quality is in a positive, and floor level is in negative

   been done. The researchers strived to standardize the unstructured data
   into structured data through web mining, text mining, and opinion
   mining. The interest in social network services(SNS), which share issues
   and opinions on issues in daily life, is also increasing. The higher the
   customer's SNS responses, the more numerous unstructured data must be
   analyzed. Users also use hash tags [#] to search for articles related to
   topics and share their opinions conveniently. These hash tags are
   implicit in meaning and can be shared by many people, and they are
   concise and more meaningful by using refined keywords among users. We
   use real-time data collection of SNS and design a system and a website
   to perform association analysis between the hash tags to understand the
   needs of customers in real-time.

AB It has become more and more difficult to identify and forecast the
   diffusion pattern based on sales data because the lifecycle of
   high-tech. products has been shortened a lot. Our study aims at
   identifying the product diffusion pattern through personal internet
   media such as blog, and further examining the potential of blog data to
   forecast the diffusion pattern of product sales. Today's mobile phone is
   characterized both by short lifecycle and active information production
   through personal internet media, and thus chosen. Collecting data by
   using web mining program, we identify the diffusion pattern of sales and
   personal internet media data of each product, and forecast the sales of
   the next period by using both sales and personal internet media data.
   Personal internet media data shows higher forecasting power than sales
   data, implying that those should be used not only in forecasting the
   product diffusion patter but in building market and sales strategy.

   통한 실제 확산패턴과 개인 미디어상의 확산패턴을 비교해 인터넷 개인 미디어 데이터를 통한 매출 확산패턴 예측의 가능성을 검증하고자
   한다. 인터넷 개인 미디어에서 가장 활발하게 정보가 창출, 교환되는 모바일폰을 대상으로, 웹 마이닝 프로그램을 개발하여 블로그
   활동 데이터를 수집했다. 비선형 곡선적합을 통해 제품별 매출/블로그 데이터의 확산패턴을 파악하고, 중회귀분석을 통해 가격 및

   This paper uses the web log explorer software to find paths used by
   customers to browse for products. Then corresponding product
   characteristics are combined using the association rule to classify
   customers. On the base of this, we try to classify new customers and
   dynamically recommend products to new customers in order to enhance
   their satisfaction. The objective is to accomplish customer and
   website's a win-win strategy. As an example, this paper analyzes three

AB Company websites are an important instrument for relationship marketing
   activities. We present a methodological framework that aligns website
   performance assessment and marketing intelligence for evaluating the
   performance of relationship marketing activities. In this context, we
   develop an extended web mining approach that integrates managerial
   perspectives in the analyst's investigation of the customer-website
   interaction based on historical clickstream data.
   This approach enables quantification of the moderating effect of a
   website's structure and content regarding website-based relationship
   marketing. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated by
   clickstream data of 477,471 visitor sessions on a software developer's
   website. The results provide detailed insights into the usage behavior
   on a website and the mechanisms to enhance e-commerce efficiency via

   Even though today's e-commerce environments have drastically evolved and
   now incorporate techniques from other domains and application areas such
   as web mining, semantics, artificial intelligence, user modeling and

   trivial or straightforward task. This paper argues that by monitoring,
   analyzing and understanding the behavior of customers, their
   demographics, opinions, preferences and history, as well as taking into
   consideration the specific e-shop ontology and by applying web mining
   techniques, the effectiveness of produced recommendations can be
   significantly improved In this way, the e-shop may upgrade users'
   interaction, increase its usability, convert users to buyers, retain
   current customers and establish long-term and loyal one-to-one

   which marketers can discover interest groups in virtual communities.
   This research demonstrates how a framework utilized within social
   networks can be used to construct a recommendation system and provide an
   example of social network marketing applications. The proposed method
   makes contributions to marketing research methods in terms of data
   collection and analysis. The integrated approach is a good fit by which

AB Currently, for content-based recommendations, semantic analysis of text
   from webpages seems to be a major problem. In this research, we present
   a semantic web content mining approach for recommender systems in online
   shopping. The methodology is based on two major phases. The first phase
   is the semantic preprocessing of textual data using the combination of a
   developed ontology and an existing ontology. The second phase uses the
   Naive Bayes algorithm to make the recommendations. The output of the
   system is evaluated using precision, recall and f-measure. The results
   from the system showed that the semantic preprocessing improved the
   recommendation accuracy of the recommender system by 5.2% over the
   existing approach. Also, the developed system is able to provide a
   platform for content-based recommendation in online shopping. This
   system has an edge over the existing recommender approaches because it
   is able to analyze the textual contents of users feedback on a product
   in order to provide the necessary product recommendation.

AB Web sites allow the collection of vast amounts of navigational data -
   clickstreams of user traversals through the site. These massive data
   stores offer the tantalizing possibility of uncovering interesting
   patterns within the dataset. For e-businesses. always looking for an
   edge in the hyper-competitive online marketplace, the discovery of
   critical edge sequences (CESs). which denote frequently traversed
   sequences in the catalog, is of significant interest. CESs can be used
   to improve site performance and site management, increase the
   effectiveness of advertising on the site, and gather additional
   knowledge of customer behavior patterns on the site.
   Using web mining strategies to find CESs turns out to be expensive in
   both space and time. In this paper, we propose an approximate algorithm
   to compute the most popular traversal sequences between node pairs in a
   catalog, which are then used to discover CESs. Our method is both fast
   and space efficient, providing a vast reduction in both the run time and
   storage requirements, with minimum impact on accuracy. (c) 2006 Elsevier

AB Customers prefer to purchase products with more features, but after
   using the products, they may become dissatisfied with the usability
   problems of the products. This phenomenon is called "feature fatigue".
   Thus it is imperative to analyze product usability in product definition
   stage. However, most traditional methods of usability evaluation are
   generally carried out using prototypes which are not available until in
   the later stage of product development. This paper proposes an approach
   based on Web mining to analyze product usability. This approach uses the
   massive online customer reviews on analogous products and features as
   data source, which are easy to get from Web and can reflect the most
   updated customer opinions on product usability. Association rule mining
   techniques are adopted to extract customer opinions on the usability of
   product features. The Apriori algorithm is used for mining association
   rules, based on which a usability evaluation method is then presented. A
   case example is given to validate the proposed approach. (C) 2014

AB In a short span of time, less than 10 years, E-Commerce industry has
   observed a magnificent growth in some of the developed countries.
   However E-Commerce industry in developing countries like India is still
   lagging behind to satisfy the challenging and dynamic needs of
   consumers. E-Commerce websites are considered as face or representatives
   of their respective companies. A well designed website is considered as
   successful website. It is designed in such a way so that it can satisfy
   user needs. Hence to have an optimized, updated and structured website
   is the ultimate goal for all E-Commerce organizations now days. In this
   regard we are going to discuss improved mining strategies which are
   required to maintain optimized website structure which in turn is
   helpful for businesses to increase their revenues, to keep check on
   competitor's websites, comparison of various brands, attracting new
   customers and to retain the old customers.

AB This study demonstrates the application of the Dominance principle to a
   particular case of web (World Wide Web) content search under
   Multi-criteria approach: searching for "Rio de Janeiro" (City and/or
   State, in Brazil) followed by other attributes (or criteria). It is
   known that depending on the content of research that is carried out
   through a "seeker" ("search engine") on the Internet, the result may
   fall short of the desirable, in terms of quantity and quality of the
   sites returned. The Dominance principle, subsequent to treatment of the
   collected information (unstructured data) on the Internet, aimed at
   revealing patterns (or logical rules) on a set of information and showed
   how a web content search can become more effective at a significant
   universe of information. Other techniques and tools have been applied to
   mining content on the Web, and as shown in this study. The choice of the
   Dominance principle associated to Rough Set Theory as Multi-criteria
   decision technique is due to the possibility of inaccurate data
   (inconsistent) and the need for treatment of these inaccuracies when
   processing an information system (data table) under a mathematical
   perspective, and do not need a history of these data. The use of Rough
   Set Theory and the Dominance principle associated with the probabilistic
   relationship between conditions and decisions in decision algorithms, is
   showed by the possibility of there being uncertain data to yield an
   essential set of effectively consistent information. (C) 2016 The

AB Regardless of the population growth trend, the number of Internet users
   is steadily increasing due to the development of networks. And the
   company’s products and services evolve in the IOT environment. Due to
   these two factors, the speed and amount of data generated through the
   Internet is increasing exponentially. In addition, data generated
   through communication between objects is used as a material that can be
   continuously developed by human beings and is used as a source of ideas
   for innovative products and services. The big data industry is at the
   center of this development. Therefore, this study aims to develop a
   system capable of processing all the processes related to big data
   analysis in real time by designing a distributed multi-processing system
   for collecting and analyzing such huge data. In order to utilize various
   media data, multi - channel data collection, first refined keyword
   centered DB center, and text mining technique using processed data were
   processed in real time. In other words, it is proved that corporate
   decision making and consumer needs analysis can be done in real time by
   collecting, storing and analyzing data at the same time.

AB The Internet has become an important medium for effective marketing and
   efficient operations for many institutions. Visitors of a particular web
   site leave behind valuable information on their preferences,
   requirements, and demands regarding the offered products and/or
   services. Understanding these requirements online, i.e., during a
   particular visit, is both a difficult technical challenge and a
   tremendous business opportunity. Web sites that can provide effective
   online navigation suggestions to their visitors can exploit the
   potential inherent in the data such visits generate every day. However,
   identifying, collecting, and maintaining the necessary knowledge that
   navigation suggestions are based on is far from trivial. We propose a
   methodology for acquiring and maintaining this knowledge efficiently
   using data mart and web mining technology. Its effectiveness has been
   shown in an application for a bank's web site.

AB Web site navigability refers to the degree to which a visitor can follow
   a Web site's hyperlink structure to successfully find information with
   efficiency and ease. In this study, we take a data-driven approach to
   measure Web site navigability using Web data readily available in
   organizations. Guided by information foraging and information-processing
   theories, we identify fundamental navigability dimensions that should be
   emphasized in metric development. Accordingly, we propose three
   data-driven metrics-namely, power, efficiency, and directness-that
   consider Web structure, usage, and content data to measure a Web site's
   navigability. We also develop a Web mining-based method that processes
   Web data to enable the calculation of the proposed metrics. We further
   implement a prototype system based on the Web mining-based method and
   use it to assess the navigability of two sizable, real-world Web sites
   with the metrics. To examine the analysis results by the metrics, we
   perform an evaluation study that involves these two sites and 248
   voluntary participants. The evaluation results show that user
   performance and assessments are consistent with the analysis results
   revealed by our metrics. Our study demonstrates the viability and
   practical value of data-driven metrics for measuring Web site
   navigability, which can be used for evaluative, diagnostic, or
   predictive purposes.

AB The role of information management and retrieval in production processes
   has been gaining in importance in recent years. In this context, the
   ability to search for and quickly find the small piece of information
   needed from the huge amount of information available has crucial
   importance. One category of tools devoted to such a task is represented
   by search engines. Satisfying the basic needs of the Web user has led to
   the research of new tools that aim at helping more sophisticated users
   (communities, companies, interest groups) with more elaborate methods.
   An example is the use of clustering and classification algorithms or
   other specific data mining techniques. In such a context, the proper use
   of a thematic search engine is a crucial tool in supporting and
   orienting many activities. Several practical and theoretical problems
   arise in developing such tools, and we try to face some of these in this
   paper, extending previous work on Web mining. Here we consider two
   related problems: how to select an appropriate set of keywords for a
   thematic engine taking into account the semantic and linguistic
   extensions of the search context, and how to select and rank a subset of
   relevant pages given a set of search keywords. Both problems are solved
   using the same framework, based on a graph representation of the
   available information and on the search of particular node subsets of
   such a graph. Such subsets are effectively identified by a
   maximum-weight clique algorithm customized ad hoc for specific problems.
   The methods have been developed in the framework of a funded research
   project for the development of new Web search tools, they have been
   tested on real data, and are currently being implemented in a prototypal
   thematic search engine. The Web mining method presented in this paper
   can be applied to Web-based design and manufacturing.

AB Many web pages are semantic diverse. That is, the whole content of a web
   page is not consistent to address one topic. However, current search
   engines are page-oriented (other than topic-oriented). But, most web
   users retrieve their target information by topics. Therefore, how to
   partition web pages by semantics is one of interesting research topics.
   In this paper, we firstly build a tree (called Semantic Tree, ST) to
   partition the web page into the content parts (called Semantic Part, SP)
   based on the web page tags. Then we analyze the characteristics of the
   words (or terms) appearing on the web page in order to build a term
   weighting formula. Based on these term weight values we employ the
   similarity formula to calculate the semantic similar degree between each
   two SPs. Finally, we consider the balance point of precision and recall
   as the reference value of the similarity-threshold. Through the work
   above we can find the content-related parts (or segmentations) of a web
   page. And we achieved a satisfied result.

   where a lot of research has been done already. Recently, companies got
   aware of its potentials, especially for applications in marketing. A
   structured methodology is, however, a crucial requirement for a
   successful practical application of web usage mining. This publication
   provides such a methodology that is based on suggestions from literature
   and own experience from various web mining projects. Its application in
   a Chilean bank shows how a combined use of data from a data warehouse
   and web data can contribute to improve marketing activities. The
   benefits from this project point at the huge potential web usage mining
   has not only in financial services. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Most existing Web search tools work only with individual users and do
   not help a user benefit from previous search experiences of others. In
   this paper, we present the Collaborative Spider, a multi-agent system
   designed to provide post-retrieval analysis and enable across-user
   collaboration in Web search and mining. This system allows the user to
   annotate search sessions and share them with other users. We also report
   a user study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this system. Our
   experimental findings show that subjects' search performance was
   degraded, compared to individual search scenarios in which users had no
   access to previous searches, when they had access to a limited number
   (e.g., 1 or 2) of earlier search sessions done by other users. However,
   search performance improved significantly when subjects had access to
   more search sessions. This indicates that gain from collaboration
   through collaborative Web searching and analysis does not outweigh the
   overhead of browsing and comprehending other users' past searches until
   a certain number of shared sessions have been reached. In this paper, we
   also catalog and analyze several different types of user collaboration
   behavior observed in the context of Web mining. (C) 2002 Elsevier

AB This paper presents a method for discriminating personal opinions from
   commercial speech. Today many personal opinions such as complaints about
   a particular product can be found on the Web. Mining useful information
   from these opinions is important for a wide range of applications.
   Personal opinions on the web, however, are often contaminated with
   commercial speech. Commercial speech is generated by companies and
   individuals for the intent of making a profit. The data cleaning process
   that discriminates personal opinions from commercial speech is important
   for obtaining useful results in opinion mining. As a data cleaning
   method, we propose a language-independent method for discriminating
   personal opinions from commercial speech based on subjectivity of text.
   Assuming that subjective words frequently occur in personal opinions
   rather than commercial speech, we define the subjectivity score of each
   word. Estimating the total subjectivity score of a given text, the
   proposed method identifies whether the given text expresses personal
   opinions or commercial comments. From experiments using texts datasets
   written in different languages, we have found over 90% of personal
   opinions can be correctly discriminated from commercial speech by the
   proposed method.

AB Potential customers are the future sources of profits. The manager can
   make decisions and manage customer relationship specifically as soon as
   finding those people. In this paper, a novel support vector machine
   (SVM) algorithm is used in web mining, in order to find potential
   customers who visit the web sites. And those potential customers are
   divided into two classes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) constructs an
   optimal hyperplane utilizing a small set of vectors near boundary.
   However, when the two-class problem samples are very unbalanced, PSVM
   tends to fit better the class with more samples and has high error in
   the class with fewer samples. To address the problem, an improved SVM
   algorithm, DFP-PSVM is presented in this paper. Computational results
   indicate that the modified algorithm has a strong capability of
   classification for the unbalanced samples of the two-class problems.

AB In the context of web mining, clustering could be used to cluster
   similar click-streams to determine learning behaviours in the case of
   e-learning, or general site access behaviours in e-commerce. Most of the
   algorithms presented in the literature to deal with clustering web
   sessions treat sessions as sets of visited pages within a time period
   and don't consider the sequence of the click-stream visitation. This has
   a significant consequence when comparing similarities between web
   sessions. We propose in this paper a new algorithm based on sequence
   alignment to measure similarities between web sessions where sessions
   are chronologically ordered sequences of page accesses.

   business in Additive Manufacturing. The study proposes a foundation of
   utilizing the Stanford NER system for tagging news data related to the
   keywords "Additive Manufacturing". The objective is to first derive the
   organization names from news data. This information is useful to define
   the digital footprints of an organization in the Additive Manufacturing
   sector. The existence of an organization derived using the NER approach
   is validated by matching their names with companies listed on the
   Companies House portal. The organization names will be matched using a
   Fuzzy-based text matching algorithm. Further information on company
   profile, officers and key financial data is extracted to provide
   information about companies interested and working within the Additive
   Manufacturing sector. This data gives an insight into which companies
   have digital footprints in the Additive Manufacturing sector within the

AB In recent years, governmental and industrial espionage becomes an
   increased problem for governments and corporations. Especially
   information about current technology development and research activities
   are interesting targets for espionage. Thus, we introduce a new and
   automated methodology that investigates the information leakage risk of
   projects in research and technology (R&T) processed by an organization
   concerning governmental or industrial espionage. Latent semantic
   indexing is applied together with machine based learning and prediction
   modeling. This identifies semantic textual patterns representing
   technologies and their corresponding application fields that are of high
   relevance for the organization's strategy. These patterns are used to
   estimate organization's costs of an information leakage for each
   project. Further, a web mining approach is processed to identify
   worldwide knowledge distribution within the relevant technologies and
   corresponding application fields. This information is used to estimate
   the probability that an information leakage occur. A risk assessment
   methodology calculates the information leakage risk for each project. In
   a case study, the information leakage risk of defense based R&T projects
   is investigated. This is because defense based R&T is of particularly
   interest by espionage agents. Overall, it can be shown that the proposed
   methodology is successful in calculation the espionage information
   leakage risk of projects. This supports an organization by processing
   espionage risk management. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Relation annotation (RA) is a process of marking up relations among a
   set of entities identified from a plain text RA is important to
   enterprise applications due to its capability of revealing semantics in
   business environments However. RA in business environment is different
   from that in news domain because the entities involved in the relations
   in business domain often not just refer to entities like People or
   Locations, and many business entitles still could not be identified by
   existing entity identification tools In this paper, we explore RA in
   business environment using web mining techniques, and propose the
   Relation Annotation Platform in Business Environments (RAPBE), which can
   automatically help information workers by annotating business relations
   in enterprise setting We evaluated RAPBE using two sample relations that
   are common in business domain -- COMPANY-LOCATION and COMPANY-PRODUCT.
   Our experiment results demonstrate the usefulness of RAPBE in relation
   annotation, and also show that the best method for marking up relations
   of the entities identifiable by existing entity identification tools is
   Frequency Weight method, whereas Distant Weight is the best when some
   entities involved in RA cannot be identified by the information

AB Automatic titling of text documents is an essential task for several
   applications (automatic heading of emails, summarization, and so forth).
   This paper describes a system facilitating information retrieval in a
   set of textual documents by tackling the automatic titling and
   subtitling issue. Automatic titling here involves providing both
   informative and catchy titles. We thus propose two different approaches
   based on NLP, text mining, and Web Mining techniques. The first one
   (POSTIT) consists of extracting relevant noun phrases from texts as
   candidate titles. An original approach combining statistical criteria
   and noun phrase positions in the text helps in collecting informative
   titles and subtitles. The second approach (NOMIT) is based on various
   assumptions made on POSTIT and aims to generate both informative and
   catchy titles. Both approaches are applied to a corpus of news articles,
   then evaluated according to two criteria, i.e. informativeness and
   catchiness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   carried in three time groups, i.e. working days in hours of work,
   working days beyond hours of work and idle days. Besides, system should
   make it possible to perform analysis for a chosen employee, position,

AB This paper considers a problem of finding predictive and useful
   association rules with anew Web mining algorithm, a streaming
   association rule (SAR) model. We first adopt a weighted order-dependent
   scheme (assigning more weights for early visited pages) rather than
   taking a traditional Boolean scheme (assigning 1 for visited and 0 for
   non-visited pages). This way, we intend to improve the limited
   representation of navigation patterns in previous association rule
   mining (ARM) algorithms. We also note that most traditional association
   rule models are not scalable because they require multiple scans of all
   records to recalibrate a predictive model when there are new updates in
   original databases. The proposed SAR model takes a "divide-and-conquer"
   approach and requires only single scan of data sets to avoid the curse
   of dimensionality. Through comparative experiments on a real-world data
   set, we show that prediction models based on a weighted order-dependent
   representation are more accurate in predicting the next moves of Web
   navigators than models based on a Boolean representation. In particular,
   when combined with several heuristics developed to eliminate redundant
   association rules, SAR models show a very comparable prediction accuracy
   while maintaining a small fraction of association rules compared to
   traditional ARM models. Finally, we quantify and graphically show the
   significance or contribution of each pages to forming unique rule sets
   in each database segments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As blogs have become one of the fastest growing types of Web-based
   media, bloggers can express their opinions and emotions more freely and
   easily than before. In the blogspace, many communities have emerged,
   which include racists and hate groups that are trying to share their
   ideology, express their views, or recruit new group members. It is
   important to analyze these cyber communities, defined based on group
   membership and subscription linkages, in order to monitor for activities
   that are potentially harmful to society. While Web mining and network
   analysis techniques have been widely used to analyze the content and
   structure of the Web sites of hate groups on the Internet, these
   techniques have not been applied to the study of hate groups in blogs.
   In this research, we propose a framework to address this problem. The
   framework consists of four modules, namely blog spider, information
   extraction, network analysis, and visualization. We applied this
   framework to identify and analyze a selected set of 28 anti-Blacks hate
   groups (820 bloggers) on Xanga, one of the most popular blog hosting
   sites. Our analysis results revealed some interesting demographical and
   topological characteristics in these groups, and identified at least two
   large communities on top of the smaller ones. We suggest that the
   proposed framework can be generalized and applied to blog analysis in
   other domains.

AB Scenario development is an established foresight method. However,
   scenario processes require much time and the integration of a balanced
   set of initial information (reports, expert interviews, etc.) remains a
   challenge. One of the key tasks in scenario development is to capture
   the topic and identify its key influences. This has potential for
   improvements. In times of big data, far more options exist for the rapid
   exploration of a topic than manual literature analysis. Hence, this work
   examines web and text mining for its usability in data retrieval and
   aggregation to improve scenario development. In this article, a new
   scenario process is proposed and described using the topic quantified
   self as an example. As the results show, web and text mining present a
   very good starting point for discussing the scenario content. The rapid
   overview with the visualizations remarkably reduces the reading effort.
   Still, future projections need to be searched manually, but the results
   from the automatic analysis comprehensively guide this step.

AB The process of information extraction from Web is both interesting and
   challenging, which could be helpful in Web Searching, Information
   Retrieval and Web Mining. Web pages on many sites are produced
   dynamically as structural records based on a HTML template from a
   background database. To efficiently extract meaningful information
   including records and data schema from the kind of pages, a new method
   based on Tag tree template is proposed. Web pages from different Web
   sites are parsed into Tag trees, and then templates of each site are
   generated from the trees by using a cost-based tree similarity
   measurement. The exclusive content in each page is then extracted by
   using the templates to parse the page. Finally, the records in pages and
   the schema of the records can be extracted from the exclusive content by
   finding repeating patterns and using some heuristic rules. The
   extraction experiments on 360 pages from 12 Web sites are performed, and
   the result shows that the proposed method is an effective way to extract
   meaningful information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB E-marketing is the concentration of all efforts in terms of adapting and
   developing marketing strategies into the virtual spaces: web, social
   media. In an e-commerce site, e-marketing must help consumers in their
   purchase. This requires precise knowledge of the customer's preferences.
   For this reason, holders of e-shops must find out to whom, to what, how
   and when to refer to the customer, ergo, to know the "consumer decision
   journey" and strengthen their engagement. This analysis is obtained when
   the customer is visiting an e-shop because (s)he leaves a digital
   footprint that can be used to understand his/her needs, desires and
   demands as well as to improve web presence. These data can be used for
   data mining to understand the e-marketing and selling processes in a
   better way. In this paper a survey of 86 e-shops in Spain is presented.
   In the conclusions, some ideas for good e-marketing practices related to
   the buying behaviour analysis of customers are shown. Hence, new trends
   in e-marketing are suggested from a strategic, tactical and operational
   level in which different data mining techniques ease the purchase and
   the engagement. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB While the amount of data available to us through the Web and the
   intranets is increasing, our capacity of reading and analyzing this
   information remains constant. Search engines instead of reducing the
   problem augment it making more and more documents quickly available to
   us. Web mining is a new research area that tries to solve the
   information overload problem by exploiting recent advances in different
   fields of technology. Documents and web pages are a source of knowledge
   in an unstructured data format that can be decodified, analyzed and
   turned into actionable intelligence thanks to online analysis by text
   mining.
   In this paper an example of a real and operative application to
   competitive intelligence (CI) is given: the Online Analyst. The final
   objective of this application is to give to end users an intelligent
   agent to read and quickly analyze huge volumes of documents retrieved
   online, especially from the web. Its typical users are intelligence
   analysts, in military as in business or politics field.
   The most exciting conclusion is that the shown approach, as also the
   prototype, here shown in a CI application case, may be already easily
   used in all e-commerce applications (currently under development
   worldwide), that take into account the necessity of working with web and

AB An important application of web usage mining is mining web log data. We
   propose a new optimised technique for web mining, in the realm of an
   e-learning site to recommend the best links for a learner to visit the
   next. It optimises web mining, by partitioning the database, on the
   basis of the learner's knowledge level, to create a suffix tree(s) from
   the existing sequences of previous 'n' learners' path. To further reduce
   the overhead of re-mining the web patterns, we propose that a web
   traversal pattern should be regarded as significant, only if it
   qualifies the minimum threshold of length and frequency in the database.
   These significant patterns are added to suffixes. They are then mined,
   using the most efficient mining algorithm after a comparative analysis
   of various algorithms, to find the most frequent navigation paths for
   recommendation to n + 1th new learner. We conducted experiments on a
   real case study of an Indian e-learning site. This is verified by
   experiments with promising results on computational time. This speed up
   obtained, in web pattern mining, is a meaningful approach for building
   recommender based e-learning system.

AB While search engines have become the major decision support tools for
   the Internet, there is a growing disparity between the image of the
   World Wide Web stored in search engine repositories and the actual
   dynamic, distributed nature of Web data. We propose to attack this
   problem using an adaptive population of intelligent agents mining the
   Web online at query time. We discuss the benefits and shortcomings of
   using dynamic search strategies versus the traditional static methods in
   which search and retrieval are disjoint. This paper presents a public
   Web intelligence tool called MySpiders, a threaded multiagent system
   designed for information discovery. The performance of the system is
   evaluated by comparing its effectiveness in locating recent, relevant
   documents with that of search engines. We present results suggesting
   that augmenting search engines with adaptive populations of intelligent
   search agents can lead to a significant competitive advantage. We also
   discuss some of the challenges of evaluating such a system on current
   Web data, introduce three novel metrics for this purpose, and outline
   some of the lessons learned in the process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

AB Recently keen interests shown in studying the goal behind a user's Web

   engine's results in turn improves the popularity of web pages.
   Advertisement fees can be decided based on this factor. Personalization
   is now becoming common term for improving E-commerce services and
   attract more users. Today's recommender system provides suggestion for
   specific items but drawback that service provider can increase the
   ratings of specific product and unnecessarily popularity increases.
   Traditional data protection mechanisms focus on access control and
   secure transmission, which provide security only against malicious third
   parties, but not the service provider. This leads to misguiding the
   users while purchasing some products, so privacy is violated. Many
   different approaches including web usage mining have been applied to the
   basic problem of developing accurate and efficient recommendation
   systems. Online business transactions and the success of E-commerce
   depend greatly on the effective design of a product recommender
   mechanism. Our proposal is founded on homomorphic encryption, which is
   used to obscure the private rating information of the customers from the
   service provider. While the user's privacy is respected by the service
   provider, by generating recommendations using encrypted customer
   ratings, the service provider's commercially valuable item-item
   similarities are protected against curious entities, in turn. Agent
   based Web mining has advantages of both Web mining and Agent: it can
   mine data efficiently and intelligently, so it is becoming more and more
   important in modern E-business.

AB Automatic classification of text documents, one of essential techniques
   for Web mining, has always been a hot topic flue to the explosive growth
   of digital documents available on-line. In text classification
   community, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) is a simple and yet effective
   classifier. However, as being a lazy learning method Without
   premodelling, kNN has a high cost to classify new documents when
   training set is large. Rocchio algorithm is another well-known and
   widely used technique for text classification. One drawback of [tie
   Rocchio classifier is that it restricts the hypothesis space to the set
   of linear separable hyperplane regions. When the data does not fit its
   underlying assumption well, Rocchio classifier suffers. In this paper, a
   hybrid algorithm based on variable precision rough set is proposed to
   combine the strength of both kNN and Rocchio techniques and overcome
   their weaknesses. Art experimental evaluation of different methods is
   carried out oil two common text corpora, i.e., the Reuters-21578
   collection and the 20-newsgroup collection. The experimental results
   indicate that the novel algorithm achieves significant performance

AB While broad "Triple Helix" frameworks of industry, government and
   university collaborations have the potential to enhance innovation and
   economic development at macro-levels, at the micro-level of the firm it
   should not be assumed that such relationships are uniform in character
   or outcomes. Each firm will negotiate and develop its own set of
   relationships with other innovation system actors based on its
   capabilities and strategies. To better understand these dynamics,
   particularly from the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises,
   this study probes the micro-level characteristics and impacts of
   external enterprise relationships. Novel website-based Triple Helix
   measures are introduced that extend the analytical scope beyond
   customary indicators (such as patent analysis or entropy measures) to
   include communication and coordination among all three helices at the
   micro-level of individual firms. This approach is used to explore the
   micro-level characteristics and impacts of industry, government and
   university relations for small and medium-sized enterprises by analyzing
   a subset of 271 U.S. green goods small and medium-sized manufacturing
   enterprises. We compare the website-based measures with case study
   results to authenticate the method. A panel data regression model is
   then employed to analyze the simultaneous impacts of various
   combinations of industry, government and university links on firm sales
   growth (2008-2011), with controls for region, scale, and application
   domains. The ability of website-based indicators to distinguish the
   impacts of different mixes of Triple Helix relations is demonstrated.
   While relationships with all three helices have a positive total

AB The evolvement of social media has made it an important and valuable
   part of people's daily life all over the world. Many businesses use
   social media in different ways that benefit their business, such as to
   advertise their products and services, and as a way of strengthening
   relationships. Institutes utilize social media to promote programs and
   courses to current and prospective students, to advertise important
   events such as career fairs and to interact with various institute
   members to provide them with up to date news and information regarding
   their wellbeing, health, security, comfort and satisfaction. Throughout
   this work, web mining and opinion mining will be applied to a general
   business Twitter account to explore the developing themes of discussions
   amongst businesses' online communities. The account will be analysed
   through text mining, social network analysis and sentiment analysis. It
   is important to monitor what topics and words are trending in high
   volume on specific online twitter communities as the objective is to try
   to conclude the sentiments of the posts posted on the Twitter account.

AB Currently, very large data have been transferred from everywhere through
   World Wide Web. Consequently, the information extraction systems have
   been arising and many researches have been focusing on those data for
   utilizing them. These systems are very useful for data pre-processing
   and cleaning for real-time applications. Moreover, these systems can
   make other analyzing systems to analyze the data in real time such as
   social network mining, web mining, data mining, or even special tasks
   such as false advertisement detection, demand forecasting, and comment
   extraction on product and service reviews. In this paper, we focus on
   extracting the content data of web pages in e-commerce web sites based
   on subject detection and node density. In the experimental results, it
   can signify that our proposed method is appropriated to extract the data
   rich region in data-intensive pages in an automatic fashion.

AB The aim of cross impact analysis (CIA) is to predict the impact of a
   first event on a second. For organization's strategic planning, it is
   helpful to identify the impacts among organization's internal events and
   to compare these impacts to the corresponding impacts of external events
   from organization's competitors. For this, literature has introduced
   compared cross impact analysis (CCIA) that depicts advantages and
   disadvantages of the relationships between organization's events to the
   relationships between competitors' events. However, CCIA is restricted
   to the use of patent data as representative for competitors' events and
   it applies a knowledge structure based text mining approach that does
   not allow considering semantic aspects from highly unstructured textual
   information. In contrast to related work, we propose an internet based
   environmental scanning procedure to identify textual patterns represent
   competitors' events. To enable processing of this highly unstructured
   textual information, the proposed methodology uses latent semantic
   indexing (LSI) to calculate the compared cross impacts (CCI) for an
   organization. A latent semantic subspace is built that consists of
   semantic textual patterns. These patterns are selected that represent
   organization's events. A web mining approach is used for crawling
   textual information from the internet based on keywords extracted from
   each selected pattern. This textual information is projected into the
   same latent semantic subspace. Based on the relationships between the
   semantic textual patterns in the subspace, CCI is calculated for
   different events of an organization. A case study shows that the
   proposed approach successfully calculates the CCI for technologies
   processed by a governmental organization. This enables decision makers
   to direct their investments more targeted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   While machine learning and statistics are known to have shortcomings

AB Purpose-This web mining paper aims at analyzing whether the number of
   links pointing to a web page is biased by the structure of web sites.
   Design/methodology/approach-By web-design mining methods, two
   collections of web pages are extracted and the in-links counts are
   determined by querying web search engines.
   Findings-The paper finds that the structure bias and pages on a higher
   hierarchical level are likely to receive more links than other pages.
   Research limitations/implications-The links are set by web page authors
   whose behaviour is not yet fully understood and which requires further
   research.
   Practical implications-The paper shows that the structure bias of
   in-links should be considered by link analysis measures used in search
   engines. Potential consequences are presented.
   Originality/value-The number of links toward a web page are considered
   to be an indicator for the quality of that page. This measure is biased
   and cannot be solely trusted as a knowledge source for the quality of a
   page.

AB Creating an academic e-Advisor to automate the process of transferring
   course credits between institutions and recommend courses for further
   study requires an extensive database of course information. This paper
   presents an application for creating such a database by automatically
   extracting relevant information from HTML course outlines stored on an
   institution's website and storing it in machine-readable XML. The
   developed application, called CODE (course outline data extractor),
   parses a course outline based on its HTML tags and content to build a
   document object model then applies a combination of web mining, natural
   language processing, and pattern recognition techniques to automatically
   classify and extract content useful for the semi-automatic e-Advisor and
   store it as XML. The current implementation is restricted to HTML course
   outlines, but the concepts can be extended to other formats of learning
   objects or entirely different domains. The quality of extraction and
   classification is evaluated for a corpus of syllabi as proof of concept.

   marketing strategy? Which competencies of employees are the most
   important for the long term company growth? How to educate the
   employees? How to improve information and communication (ICT) using? The
   answers to these questions are examined in this article. In the last
   fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by
   qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies
   which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm
   capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in
   combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have
   been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web
   presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining
   methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree
   classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection
   methods and hierarchical cluster analysis.
   The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence
   between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term
   growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an
   organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the
   competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of
   ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within
   thirty enterprises using multiple interviews. Some companies had
   developed significantly more ICT competencies than the others and these
   competencies help them to be more successful and competitive.

AB Web-based commerce systems fail to achieve many of the features that
   enable small businesses to develop a friendly human relationship with
   customers. Although many enterprises have worried about user
   identification to solve the problem, the solution goes far beyond trying
   to find out what navigator's behavior looks like. Many approaches have
   recently been proposed to enrich the data in web logs with semantics
   related to the business so that web mining algorithms can later be
   applied to discover patterns and trends. In this paper we present an
   innovative method of log enrichment as several goals and viewpoints of
   the organization owning the site are taken into account. By later
   applying discriminant analysis to the information enriched this way, it
   is possible to identify the relevant factors that contribute most to the
   success of a session for each viewpoint under consideration. The method
   also helps to estimate ongoing session value in terms of how the
   company's objectives and expectations are being achieved.

AB It is estimated that over seven billion static pages exist in the Web
   today, and backend databases can potentially produce at least three
   times as many dynamic pages. However, the best search engines index only
   approximately 20% of the static pages. So the real question is: While
   the Web is certainly the most amazing and comprehensive information
   source ever created, are you really getting all the information you need
   for your specific purpose? The answer to this question is mostly "yes"
   for the individual user, who uses the Web as an information source for
   casual purposes. However, for an individual who uses the Web as an
   essential and comprehensive source of information-for business or
   research-the answer is quite the opposite. Even a sophisticated Web user
   requires a significant amount of time and effort to find all of the
   information needed for a given task. In this paper the concept of Web
   Business Intelligence (WBI) is introduced, an emerging class of software
   that leverages the unprecedented content on the Web to extract
   actionable knowledge in an organizational setting. The contributions
   include an architecture for WBI, a survey of technologies relevant to
   the various components of the architecture, and illustration of the
   value of WBI by means of a detailed example from the e-finance domain.
   This article concludes with a discussion on the future of WBI.

AB The tourism industry has experienced a shift from offline to online
   travellers and this has made the use of intelligent systems in the
   tourism sector crucial. These information systems should provide tourism
   consumers and service providers with the most relevant information, more
   decision support, greater mobility and the most enjoyable travel
   experiences. As a consequence, Destination Marketing Organizations
   (DMOs) not only have to respond by adopting new technologies, but also
   by interpreting and using the knowledge created by the use of these
   techniques. This work presents the design of a general and non-invasive
   web mining system, built using the minimum information stored in a web
   server (the content of the website and the information from the log
   files stored in Common Log Format (CLF)) and its application to the
   Bidasoa Turismo (BTw) website. The proposed system combines web usage
   and content mining techniques with the three following main objectives:
   generating user navigation profiles to be used for link prediction;
   enriching the profiles with semantic information to diversify them,
   which provides the DMO with a tool to introduce links that will match
   the users taste; and moreover, obtaining global and language-dependent
   user interest profiles, which provides the DMO staff with important
   information for future web designs, and allows them to design future
   marketing campaigns for specific targets. The system performed
   successfully, obtaining profiles which fit in more than 60% of cases
   with the real user navigation sequences and in more than 90% of cases
   with the user interests. Moreover the automatically extracted semantic
   structure of the website and the interest profiles were validated by the
   BTw DMO staff, who found the knowledge provided to be very useful for
   the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With large audience base for popular TV programs, vendors usually place
   program-related product information implicitly by product placement, or
   embedded marketing schemes. They target at specific groups of audience
   who might be interested in the products for promotion purpose. Thus,
   contextual advertising technique is usually applied in matching product
   information with relevant Web pages. However, it cannot be directly
   applied to TV programs without suitable metadata. In this paper, we
   propose a Web mining approach to implicit concept discovery for popular
   TV programs. First, major topics in programs are extracted by keyphrase
   extraction and topic filtering methods. Then, implicit relevance
   analysis is performed between topics and related categories in various
   social Web forums to identify implicit concepts. In the experiments, we
   evaluated the performance of our proposed approach for popular Korean,
   Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese dramas. As the experimental results
   show, an average precision of 65.11% can be achieved for popular dramas.
   This validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in discovering
   implicitly relevant concepts from social media.

AB Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) is a double structure
   mixture model which has got a wide application in text and web mining.
   This method is capable of establishing hidden semantic relations among
   the observed features, using a number of latent variables. In this
   approach, the selection of the correct number of latent variables is
   critical. In the most of the previous researches, the number of latent
   topics was selected based on the number of invoked classes. This paper
   presents a method, based on backward elimination approach, which is
   capable of unsupervised order selection in PISA. This method starts with
   a model having a number of components more than the needed value, and
   then prunes the mixtures to reach their optimum size. During the
   elimination process, proper selection of some latent variables which
   must be deleted is the most essential problem, and its relation to the
   final performance of the pruned model is straightforward. To treat this
   problem, we introduce a new combined pruning method which selects the
   best options for removal, while keeping a low computational cost, at
   all. We conducted,some experiments on two datasets from Reuters-21578
   corpus. The obtained results show that this algorithm leads to an
   optimized number of latent variables and in turn achieves better
   clustering performance compared to the conventional model selection
   methods. It also shows superiority over the case in which a PLSA model
   with a fixed number of latent variables, equal to the real number of
   clusters, is exploited. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past decade, an increasing number of efficient algorithms have
   been proposed to mine frequent patterns by satisfying the minimum
   support threshold. Generally, determining an appropriate value for
   minimum support threshold is extremely difficult. This is because the
   appropriate value depends on the type of application and expectation of
   the user. Moreover, in some real-time applications such as web mining
   and e-business, finding new correlations between patterns by changing
   the minimum support threshold is needed. Since rerunning mining
   algorithms from scratch is very costly and time-consuming, researchers
   have introduced interactive mining of frequent patterns. Recently, a few
   efficient interactive mining algorithms have been proposed, which are
   able to capture the content of transaction database to eliminate
   possibility of the database rescanning. In this paper, we propose a new
   method based on prime number and its characteristics mainly for
   interactive mining of frequent patterns. Our method isolates the mining
   model from the mining process such that once the mining model is
   constructed; it can be frequently used by mining process with various
   minimum support thresholds. During the mining process, the mining
   algorithm reduces the number of candidate patterns and comparisons by
   using a new candidate set called candidate head set and several
   efficient pruning techniques. The experimental results verify the
   efficiency of our method for interactive mining of frequent patterns.

AB Many applications, such as telecommunication and commercial video
   broadcasting systems, computer and networks, and Web mining, require
   modeling data streams that exhibit context dependency. Context
   dependency refers to the fact that the statistical distribution of a new
   sample is heavily conditioned by a set of the most recent samples that
   precedes it. However, statistical models such as context trees (CTs)
   that capture context dependency tend to be poorly scalable. This paper
   proposes a solution to the scalability problem of these models by
   transforming a data stream into high-level aggregates of clusters
   instead of modeling the original data stream. Using an
   information-theoretical approach, we leverage existing clustering
   techniques for static categorical data sets to capture dynamic data
   streams based on the CT models. Because the proposed approach can be
   applied repeatedly on different levels of a clustering hierarchy, it is
   suitable for predicting trends and detecting anomalies at any aggregate
   (or detail) level required. Experimental results, including video stream
   modeling, network intrusion detection, and Monte Carlo simulations, show
   that the proposed method is efficient in capturing high-level aggregates
   of large-scale dynamic systems and very effective for trend prediction
   and anomaly detection.

AB With evolution of social network and Web 2.0, people not only consume
   content by downloading on web but also contribute and produce new
   contents. People became more eager to express and share their opinions
   on web regarding daily activities as well as local or global issues. Due
   to the proliferation of social media for instance Facebook, Twitter,
   Youtube and others, sentiment analysis and opinion mining grow rapidly.
   It branches out from the field of natural language processing and data
   mining particularly from web mining and text mining. Why sentiment
   analysis and also known as opinion mining is prevalent and relevant
   nowadays? When we try to decide to purchase a product, we are likely to
   get the opinions from friends or relatives and do some surveys before we
   purchase the product. Hence, opinions are undeniably the key influencer
   of our behavior as well as the central to nearly all of the activities.
   Within the opinions, we often find the neutral, positive and negative
   polarities in the sentences. Based on the sentiment analysis taxonomy,
   it has opinion mining to have the opinion polarity classification,
   subjectivity detection, opinion spam detection, opinion summarization
   and argument expression detection. On the other hand, emotion mining has
   the emotion polarity classification, emotion detection, emotion cause
   detection and emotion classification. If it is based on granularity
   level, it has sentence level, document level and aspect/entity level of
   sentiment analysis. As for the machine learning approaches, it has
   semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning and supervised learning
   of sentiment analysis.

AB Most traditional cache document replacement policies are focused on the
   efficiency aspect and these documents are replaced according to their
   last access times, request frequencies, and sizes. However, in addition
   to providing efficient document acquisition service, a successful
   commercial website also has to create incentives for customers, so as to
   gain sufficient revenues to support the continuing operation of the
   website. For this reason, a new cache document replacement policy
   considering the contribution-to-sales of every document is proposed in
   this study. In order to evaluate the contribution-to-sales of a
   document, two web mining techniques are applied. Then the traditional
   GDSF policy is modified to incorporate this new factor. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an experimental EC website
   has been constructed, and a series of computer programs have been
   developed to simulate the accesses by various kinds of users to the
   website and to obtain some data for rudimentary analyses. The results
   showed that the proposed replacement policy could at most increase the
   hit rate and the byte hit rate by 16% and 9%, respectively, for
   customers compared with traditional replacement policies. (c) 2005

AB Lead users are the group of most valuable users in product innovation
   and new product development for a certain firm. Based on web mining
   methods on user innovation communities, this paper presents quantitative
   methodology to evaluate the contributions and values of online community
   users to identify lead users. Firstly, we analyze user behaviors and
   calculate the user interest index (UII) of posts, keywords and
   innovation fields to measure the popularity of innovations based on
   other users' focus. Secondly, the model of User Innovation Knowledge
   supernetwork (UIKSN) is proposed, in which UIIs and user contributions
   are considered as two types of node weights for integrating behavior
   data and content data. And then, rules and methods are suggested based
   on the UIKSN model for identifying lead users to meet various
   requirements including contributions and UIIs in posts, keywords, hot
   frontiers, core innovation fields, and even in certain fields or
   knowledge points. Furthermore, knowledge structures are analyzed through
   ego-network analysis. Case studies show that the proposed UIKSN model
   and methodology are more objective and credible and thus have good
   potentials for identifying and analyzing lead users from multiple
   levels, such as posts, keywords, hot front, core innovation fields, etc.

   opinions expressed by users in tourism related online platforms.
   Extracting opinions from user generated reviews, regarding aspects
   specific to hotel services, are useful both to clients looking for
   accommodation, and also hotels trying to improve their services. The
   proposed system extracts hotel reviews from internet and classifies
   them, using an opinion mining technique. Platform is evaluated using a
   manually pre-classified dataset of user reviews. In the paper the
   efficiency of algorithms are analyzed using text mining domain specific

AB As Internet usage has heavily increased within recent years, money
   launderers have started to take advantage of Online Financial
   Transaction (OFT) services to facilitate their money laundering
   activities. However, law enforcement has struggled to understand and
   detect OFT services that criminals use for money laundering. To assist
   law enforcement in its efforts to identify and monitor OFT services, we
   have designed the Online Financial Transaction Services Identification
   Tool (OFTSIT), which crawls the Internet and determines the probability
   that they are OFT services. OFTSIT analyzes a website's content and
   extracts textual features using latent semantic indexing (LSI). LSI is a
   text mining approach that can extract a small number (< 10) of features
   from more than 40,000 possible words on a website. OFTSIT inputs the LSI
   discovered features into a generalized linear model to produce the
   probability that a website is an OFT service. Testing showed that OFTSIT
   outperforms current method of manual searching. This paper describes the
   system architecture, algorithms employed to classify OFT services from
   other websites, and performance testing to demonstrate OFTSIT's
   operational relevance.

AB Grouping customer transactions into segments may help understand
   customers better. The marketing literature has concentrated on
   identifying important segmentation variables (e.g., customer loyalty)
   and on using cluster analysis and mixture models for segmentation. The
   data mining literature has provided various clustering algorithms for
   segmentation without focusing specifically on clustering customer
   transactions. Building on the notion that observable customer
   transactions are generated by latent behavioral traits, in this paper,
   we investigate using a pattern-based clustering approach to grouping
   customer transactions. We define an objective function that we maximize
   in order to achieve a good clustering of customer transactions and
   present an algorithm, GHIC, that groups customer transactions such that
   itemsets generated from each cluster, while similar to each other, are
   different from ones generated from others. We present experimental
   results from user-centric Web usage data that demonstrates that GHIC
   generates a highly effective clustering of transactions.

AB Partitioning a given data-set into subsets based on similarity among the
   data is called clustering. Clustering is a major task in data mining and
   machine learning having many applications such as text retrieval,
   pattern recognition, and web mining. Here, we briefly review some
   clustering related problems (k-means, normalized k-cut, orthogonal
   non-negative matrix factorization, ONMF, and isoperimetry) and describe
   their connections. We formulate the relaxed mean version of the
   isoperimetry problem as an optimization problem with non-negative
   orthogonal constraints. We first make use of a gradient-based
   optimization algorithm to solve this kind of a problem, and then apply a
   post-processing technique to extract a solution of the clustering
   problem. Also, we propose a simplified approach to improve upon solution
   of the 2-dimensional clustering problem, using the N-nearest neighbor
   graph. Inspired by this technique, we apply a multilevel method for
   clustering a given data-set to reduce the size of the problem by
   grouping a number of similar vertices. The number is determined based on
   two values, namely, the maximum and the average of the edge weights of
   the vertices connected to a selected vertex. In addition, using the
   connections between ONMF and k-means and between k-means and the
   isoperimetry problem, we propose an algorithm to solve the ONMF problem.
   A comparative performance analysis of our approach with other related
   methods shows outperformance of our approach, in terms of the obtained
   misclassification error rate and Rand index, on both benchmark and
   randomly generated problems as well as hard synthetic data-sets.

AB Information overload often hinders knowledge discovery on the Web.
   Existing tools lack analysis and visualization capabilities. Search
   engine displays often overwhelm users with irrelevant information. This
   research proposes a visual framework for knowledge discovery on the Web.
   The framework incorporates Web mining, clustering, and visualization
   techniques to support effective exploration of knowledge. Two new
   browsing methods were developed and applied to the business intelligence
   domain: Web community uses a genetic algorithm to organize Web sites
   into a tree format; knowledge map uses a multidimensional scaling
   algorithm to place Web sites as points on a screen. Experimental results
   show that knowledge map outperformed Kartoo, a commercial search engine
   with graphical display, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Web
   community was found to be more effective, efficient, and usable than
   result list. Our visual framework thus helps to alleviate information
   overload on the Web and offers practical implications for search engine
   developers.

AB Recommender systems are a personalized information filtering technology
   to help customers find the products they would like to purchase.
   Collaborative filtering is known to be the most successful
   recommendation technology, but its widespread use has exposed some
   problems such as sparsity and scalability in the e-business environment.
   In this paper, we propose a recommendation system, WebCF-PT based on Web
   usage mining and product taxonomy to enhance the recommendation quality
   and the system performance of traditional CF-based recommender systems.
   Web usage mining populates the rating database by tracking customers’
   shopping behaviors on the Web, so leading to better quality
   recommendations. The product taxonomy is used to improve the performance
   of searching for nearest neighbors through dimensionality reduction of
   the rating database. A prototype recommendation system, WebCF-PT is
   developed and internet shopping mall, EBIB(e-Business & Intelligence
   Business) is constructed to test the WebCF-PT system.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to anonymize web server log files
   used in e-commerce web mining processes.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper has applied statistical
   disclosure control (SDC) techniques to achieve its goal. More precisely,
   it has introduced the micro-aggregation of web access logs.
   Findings - The experiments show that the proposed technique provides
   good results in general, but it is especially outstanding when dealing
   with relatively small websites.
   Research limitations/implications - As in all SDC techniques there is
   always a trade-off between privacy and utility or, in other words,
   between disclosure risk and information loss. In this proposal, it has
   borne this issue in mind, providing k-anonymity, while preserving
   acceptable information accuracy.
   Practical implications - Web server logs are valuable information used
   nowadays for user profiling and general data-mining analysis of a
   website in e-commerce and e-services. This Proposal allows anonymizing
   such logs, so they can be safely outsourced to other companies for
   marketing purposes, stored for further analysis, or made publicly
   available, without risking customer privacy.
   Originality/value - Current solutions to the problem presented here are
   very poor and scarce. They are normally reduced to the elimination of
   sensitive information from query strings of URLs in general. Moreover,
   to its knowledge, the use of SDC techniques has never been applied to
   the anonymization of web logs.

AB A web shopping mall is a powerful vehicle for attracting a lot of
   customers to the Internet. To analyze customer's purchasing pattern, a
   wide variety of web mining tools were used in literature. However, those
   tools suffer from the lack of considering cause-effect relationship
   between several factors consisting of the web shopping mall. In this
   sense, we propose using fuzzy cognitive map(FCM) to analyze customer's
   purchasing pattern. To add more rigorous analysis procedures, we
   introduce a concept of core FCM and unified FCM. To induce a meaningful
   FCM, we applied web log analysis, sorting out a set of useful causal
   relationships among the components of web shopping mall. Simulation
   results with unified FCM yielded that the proposed approach using FCM is
   robust and powerful for analysing customer's hidden purchasing pattern
   on a specific web shopping mall.

   Two networks have been extracted for representing websites: a domain
   network containing subdomains or external domains linked through the
   website and a page network containing webpages browsed from the root
   domain. Factor analysis provides the statistical methodology to
   adequately extract the main website profiles in terms of their internal
   structure. However, due to the large number of indicators, the task of
   selecting a representative subset of indicators becomes unaffordable. A
   genetic search of an optimum subset of indicators is proposed in this
   paper, selecting a multiobjective fitness function based on factor
   analysis results. The optimum solution provides a coherent and relevant
   categorization of website profiles, and highlights the possibilities of
   genetic algorithms as a tool for discovering new knowledge in the field

AB Web search engines have become an integral part of the daily life of a
   knowledge worker, who depends on these search engines to retrieve
   relevant information from the Web or from the company's vast document
   databases. Current search engines are very fast in terms of their
   response time to a user query. But their usefulness to the user in terms
   of retrieval performance leaves a lot to be desired. Typically, the user
   has to sift through a lot of nonrelevant documents to get only a few
   relevant ones for the user's information needs. Ranking functions play a
   very important role in the search engine retrieval performance. In this
   paper, we describe a methodology using genetic programming to discover

   for both the ad hoc task and the routing task in retrieval. For either
   of the retrieval tasks, the retrieval performance of these newly
   discovered ranking functions has been found to be superior to the
   performance obtained by well-known ranking strategies in the information

AB With the unstable growth of the Web, there is an ever- Increasing volume
   of data and information published in numerous Web pages. Web mining aims
   to develop new techniques to effectively extract and mine useful
   knowledge or information from these Web pages. And allows user to easily
   locate desired object from huge data. In this paper, we propose simple
   web site mining technique by mining product information from the pages
   of the e-commercial web site. For this we are taking the benefits of
   hierarchical structure of HTML language. First it discovers the set of
   product descriptions based on the measure of entropy at each node in the
   HTML tag tree of the retrieved web page. Afterward, a set of association
   rules based on heuristic features is employed for more accuracy in the
   product extraction.

AB In a context of intensification of international trade and travels, the
   transboundary spread of emerging human or animal pathogens represents a
   growing concern. One of the missions of the national veterinary services
   is to implement international epidemiological intelligence for a timely
   and accurate detection of emerging animal infectious diseases (EAID)
   worldwide, and take early actions to prevent their introduction on the
   national territory. For this purpose, an efficient use of the
   information published on the web is essential. The authors present a
   comprehensive method for identification of relevant associations between
   terms describing clinical signs and hosts to build queries to monitor
   the web for early detection of EAID. Using text and web mining
   approaches, they present statistical measures for automatic selection of
   relevant associations between terms. In addition, expert elicitation is
   used to highlight the most relevant terms and associations among those
   automatically selected. The authors assessed the performance of the
   combination of the automatic approach and expert elicitation to monitor
   the web for a list of selected animal pathogens.

AB Web content mining aims to discover useful information and generate
   desired knowledge from a large amount of web pages. Key information,
   such as distinctive menu items, navigation indicators, which is embedded
   in web pages, can help classify the main contents of web pages and
   reflect certain taxonomy knowledge. Therefore, mining key information is
   significant in helping acquire domain knowledge and build catalogue
   classifiers. Current web content mining methods cannot mine such key
   information effectively. "Noise information" (such as advertisements) is
   a problem for the performance of web mining tasks. This paper proposes a
   method to extract key information out of web pages which contain noisy
   information. The method contains two steps: to extract a list of
   candidate key information, and then apply entropy measure to filter
   noisy information and discover key information. Experiment results show
   that this method is effective in discovering key information. With the
   discovered key information that reflects taxonomy knowledge, an
   application is developed to help ontology generation. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   diverse customer base is generally viewed as an opportunity, it can also
   represent increase in competition among e-commerce platforms. Hence,
   e-commerce needs to develop sophisticated strategies to attract and
   retain customers, one of which is done through personalization in web
   services. Recommendation system, one form of web service personalization
   in e-commerce platform, predicts user preferences and helps them find
   products that they may be interested in by implementing web mining
   techniques. This empirical research investigated user web log data which
   illustrate behavior and implicit preferences of customers in one of
   e-commerce in Indonesia to predict user preferred product category in
   their future request. In this study, model-based recommendation system
   was built based on users' activity in a session and site type using C5.0
   algorithm of decision tree technique. Top N recommendations were given
   based on probability-based ranking of categories resulted from

   e-commerce opportunities through the wireless web services. Wireless
   Internet access has inherent limitations since most handheld devices
   have much less display and means of operations. This imposes a
   particular problem to the design of mobile information services in terms
   of information and service navigation. In this paper, a novel approach
   called SmartClick is presented to achieve user-centered wireless web
   services. SmartClick enables users to explicitly express their
   intentions or preferences with minimal clicks (user interaction).
   SmartClick with a middle ware support provides users a way to get the

AB Defining Web query languages has received much attention in the last few
   years. A typical system consists of a wrapper which maps a data source
   to a common data model and on which semantic integration is provided.
   However, constructing wrappers is time-consuming and can cater for tens,
   but not thousands of data sources. New methods should thus be
   investigated and then developed. In this paper, we present a novel model
   to retrieve information from the WWW. It is designed for ad hoc users
   and employs sample-based mining to extract the desirable data. Our
   method is more flexible than the wrapper approach. (C) 2003 Elsevier

   support decision-making of people. However, people have a difference of
   information access environment, ability to understand information and
   information pursuit desire, and so on, so that they have the information
   gap which affects profit gaps among them. Therefore, we suggest an
   intelligent web information system for minimizing information gap in
   government agencies and public institutions so that disadvantaged people
   can understand web contents and they make the more profit in their
   economic behaviors. In order to remove information gap, various and
   useful contents should be designed and managed so that disadvantaged
   people can understand easily and utilize beneficently. The government
   agencies and public institutions should provide the disadvantaged people
   that are experiencing the problem of information gap with the requisite
   web contents that can be understood by them. This paper discusses the
   desirable web information system in the government agencies and public
   institutions based on web intelligence technology such as web mining and
   web personalization tools for the providing the class of information
   weakness with the requisite web contents and supporting their successful

AB While the volume of data from heterogeneous sources grows considerably,
   foresight and its methods rarely benefit from such available data. This
   work concentrates on textual data and considers its use in foresight to
   address new research questions and integrate other stakeholders. This
   textual data can be accessed and systematically examined through text
   mining which structures and aggregates data in a largely automated
   manner. By exploiting new data sources (e.g. Twitter, web mining), more
   actors and views are integrated, and more emphasis is laid on the
   analysis of social changes. The objective of this article is to explore
   the potential of text mining for foresight by considering different data
   sources, text mining approaches, and foresight methods. After clarifying
   the potential of combining text mining and foresight, examples are
   outlined for roadmapping and scenario development. As the results show,
   text mining facilitates the detection and examination of emerging topics
   and technologies by extending the knowledge base of foresight. Hence,
   new foresight applications can be designed. In particular, text mining
   provides a solid base for reflecting on possible futures. (C) 2016

EA SEP 2021
PY 2021
AB Detecting product adoption intentions on social media could yield
   significant value in a wide range of applications, such as personalized
   recommendations and targeted marketing. In the literature, no study has
   explored the detection of product adoption intentions on social media,
   and only a few relevant studies have focused on purchase intention
   detection for products in one or several categories. Focusing on a
   product category rather than a specific product is too coarse-grained
   for precise advertising. Additionally, existing studies primarily focus
   on using one type of text representation in target social media posts,
   ignoring the major yet unexplored potential of fusing different text
   representations. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of
   product adoption intention mining and demonstrate the necessity of
   studying this problem and its practical value. To detect a product
   adoption intention for an individual product, we propose a novel and
   general multiview deep learning model that simultaneously taps into the
   capability of multiview learning in leveraging different representations
   and deep learning in learning latent data representations using a
   flexible nonlinear transformation. Specifically, the proposed model
   leverages three different text representations from a multiview
   perspective and takes advantage of local and long-term word relations by
   integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term
   memory (LSTM) modules. Extensive experiments on three Twitter datasets
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multiview deep learning
   model compared with the existing benchmark methods. This study also
   significantly contributes research insights to the literature about
   intention mining and provides business value to relevant stakeholders
   such as product providers.

   frameworks are limited to server-sided tracking, and the firms lose
   their customers' footprints once the customers leave their web sites.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a framework of user remote tracker, and
   this tracking method can be used to discover much value of customer
   information. We implemented this tracker, and used it to record the
   Internet activities from web users in a controlled lab experiment
   setting. We performed preliminary data analysis to draw a linkage
   between web customers' characteristics (such as personality traits) and

   utilization was insufficient. The quality level of the app, including
   the level of consumers' needs, has shown a wide gap between the
   apps.Implications: The recent development of mobile apps for hospital
   accessibility and consumer needs has shown a wide gap in the quality of

   American psychologist Dr. Robert Plutchik (1980) to restructure with
   Korean language. Netizens use the tag "#" in the SNS post as a mean of
   expressing various expressions and emotions. Korean emotions expression
   is composed of various consonant and vowel combinations to express the
   same emotional expression in different ways. It is also a reason why it
   is difficult to mine Korean natural language due to abbreviated
   expressions, words used on the Internet and in chatroom.In this study,
   we propose an algorithm for extracting metadata from the same emotional
   word used by netizens and generalizing emotional words. Using 150,000
   emotional hashtags, we divided them into seven emotional sets and shared
   generalized results with 104 emotional words.Especially, each 40,000
   hashtags were generalized to emotion words with 18 "angry" and 26
   "happy" emotion words. We hope that the generalization process includes
   necessary algorithms and will be useful in the study of Korean natural

AB The problem of growing computational complexity in finance industry
   demands manageable, high-speed and real-time solutions in solving
   complex mathematical problems such as option pricing. In option trading
   scenario, determining a fair price for options "any time" and
   "any-where" has become vital yet difficult computational problem. In
   this study, we have designed, implemented, and deployed architecture for
   pricing options on-line using a hand-held device that is J2ME-based
   Mobile computing-enabled and is assisted by web mining tools. In our
   architecture, the client is a MIDP user interface, and the back end
   servlet runs on a standalone server bound to a known port address. In
   addition, the server uses table-mining techniques to mine real-time data
   from reliable web sources upon the mobile trader's directive. The server
   performs all computations required for pricing options since mobile
   devices have limited battery power, low bandwidth, and low memory. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that
   facilitate the mobile-enabled-trader to compute the price of an option
   in ubiquitous fashion. This architecture aims at providing the trader
   with various computational techniques to avail (to provide results from
   approximate to accurate results) while on-the-go and to make important
   and effective trading decisions using the results that will ensure
   higher returns on investments in option trading.

AB There is growing interest in using intelligent software agents for a
   variety of tasks, including navigating and retrieving information from
   the Internet and from databases, online shopping activities, user
   authentication, negotiation for resources, and decision making. This
   paper proposes an integrated framework for information retrieval and
   information filtering in the context of Internet shopping. The work
   focuses on applying agent technology, together with Web mining
   technology, to automate a series of product search and selection
   activities. It is based on a multiagent development platform, namely,
   iJADE (Intelligent Java Agent Development Environment), which supports
   various e-commerce applications. The framework comprises an automatic
   facial authentication utility and six other modules, namely, customer
   requirements definition, a requirement-fuzzification scheme, a fuzzy
   agents-negotiation scheme, a fuzzy product-selection scheme, a
   product-defuzzification scheme, and a product-evaluation scheme. A
   series of experiments were carried out and favorable results were
   produced in executing the framework. From an experimental point of view,
   we used a database of 1,020 facial,images that were obtained under
   various conditions of facial expression, viewing perspective and size.
   An overall correct recognition rate of over 85 percent was attained. For
   the product selection test of our fuzzy shopper system, an average
   matching rate of more than 81 percent was achieved.

AB We investigate the degree and duration of the effects of deceptive
   signaling on globalized digital platforms, vis-a-vis naturally formed
   organic signaling such as importer review scores and discernible
   inducing signaling such as banner advertisements. Sponsored listing has
   emerged as a powerful tool for facilitating Internet-mediated exchanges
   in internationalization activities. Some digital platforms based in
   weakly regulated countries provide sponsored listing to exporters
   without explicitly disclosing that sponsorship. This constitutes a
   deceptive signal to importers in strongly regulated countries whose
   governments require sponsorship disclosure. Deceptive signaling is
   hypothesized to stimulate an institutional hypnosis on importers, with
   the most immediate and largest enhancing effects on exporter performance
   of the three types of signaling. Organic signaling is hypothesized to
   exert the most durable effect. Using transaction-level data from a
   globalized digital platform assembled with web mining methods, we
   develop a novel algorithm to detect deceptive signaling. Regression
   results from generalized method of moments estimation support these
   hypotheses. Our study is among the first to investigate institutional
   hypnosis manifested in increasingly widespread and unchecked forms in
   digitized international business transacting. By discovering and
   reporting on a dark side of institutional arbitrage, we offer actionable
   implications for digital platform governance, participants, and
   regulators.

AB The study presented in the paper contributes to covering the gap in the
   area of sufficient information disclosure that also increases the
   interests of relevant stakeholders in contributing to depository market
   discipline and in being relevant to their interest within Pillar 3
   framework. This paper is focused on an analysis of website data
   dedicated to Pillar 3 disclosures of commercial banks and on studying
   the behaviour of stakeholders in relation to the timing of serious
   market turbulence. The examined data consists of log files that were
   pre-processed using web mining techniques and from which were extracted
   frequent itemsets by quarters and evaluated in terms of quantity. The
   authors have proposed a methodology to evaluate frequent itemsets of web
   parts over a dedicated time period. The results show that stakeholders'
   interest in disclosures is lower after turbulent times in 2009, higher
   in the first quarter, also higher together with annual reports (lower
   for Pillar 3 solo information). The paper's results suggest that further
   changes in commercial banks' information disclosure are inevitable in
   order to achieve an effective market discipline mechanism and meaningful
   disclosures according to the regulator's expectations.

AB We investigate an automated identification of weak signals according to
   Ansoff to improve strategic planning and technological forecasting.
   Literature shows that weak signals can be found in the organization's
   environment and that they appear in different contexts. We use internet
   information to represent organization's environment and we select these
   websites that are related to a given hypothesis. In contrast to related
   research, a methodology is provided that uses latent semantic indexing
   (LSI) for the identification of weak signals. This improves existing
   knowledge based approaches because LSI considers the aspects of meaning
   and thus, it is able to identify similar textual patterns in different
   contexts. A new weak signal maximization approach is introduced that
   replaces the commonly used prediction modeling approach in LSI. It
   enables to calculate the largest number of relevant weak signals
   represented by singular value decomposition (SVD) dimensions. A case
   study identifies and analyses weak signals to predict trends in the
   field of on-site medical oxygen production. This supports the planning
   of research and development (R&D) for a medical oxygen supplier. As a
   result, it is shown that the proposed methodology enables organizations
   to identify weak signals from the internet for a given hypothesis. This
   helps strategic planners to react ahead of time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, we have been observing a new paradigm of attacks, the
   so-called cryptojacking attacks. Given the lower-risk/lowereffort nature
   of cryptojacking, the number of such incidents in 2018 were nearly
   double of those of ransomware attacks. Apart from the cryptojackers,
   web-cryptomining library providers also enabled benign publishers to use
   this mechanism as an alternative monetization schema for web in the era
   of declined ad revenues. In spite of the buzz raised around
   web-cryptomining, it is not yet known what is the profitability of
   webcryptomining and what is the actual cost it imposes on the user side.
   In this paper, we respond to this exact question by measuring the
   overhead imposed to the user with regards to power consumption,
   resources utilization, network traffic, device temperature and user
   experience. We compare those overheads along with the profitability of
   webcryptomining to the ones imposed by advertising to examine if
   webcryptomining can become a viable alternative revenue stream for
   websites. Our results show that web-cryptomining can reach the
   profitability of advertising under specific circumstances, but users
   need to sustain a significant cost on their devices.

AB Although Internet studies have focused so far on using website content
   for gathering business information, still web hyperlinks have not really
   been exploited directly for business purposes. Webometrics is a new
   discipline that applies bibliometric techniques to the quantitative
   study of the Web, as well as new concepts and methodology. So far
   studies in this field have focused on academic and scholarly Web spaces;
   however this methodology is equally applicable to commercial sites which
   dominate the Web. This paper shows how webometric methodology could be
   applied to business and management studies. The study describes a number
   of concepts and techniques and their potential to provide better insight
   into business environment. Search engines are the main source of
   information for gathering link data. Some studies found that the number
   of links pointing to company websites correlate significantly with the
   company's business performance measures. This finding shows that links
   to a website could also be used as a timely indicator of business
   performance. Secondly, the examination of co-links (which means that a
   webpage links two business sites at the same time) between pairs of
   business sites are a potential source of business competition
   information. Qualitative studies have shown that links to competitors
   are extremely rare, but competitors are often co-linked. The hypothesis
   tested in these studies suggests that the number of co-links to the
   websites of a pair of companies is a measure of the similarity between
   the two companies and therefore it could provide information about their
   competitive positions in the industry. Finally, motivations for the
   creation of hyperlinks to business sites could be analysed through a
   content analysis approach in order to get confirmation about the
   business relevance and nature of links. This view complements the
   quantitative perspective to link and co-link research, providing a brand
   new approach to business studies.

AB Market discipline has been a scrutinized area since the last financial
   crisis in 2008. Regulators strengthened their role particularly through
   Pillar 3 in Basel III. However, there are still some aspects of market
   discipline that deserve special attention to avoid future failures. This
   study focuses on the analysis of the interest and behaviour of deposit
   stakeholders based on website data dedicated to disclosures of
   commercial bank in Slovakia during and after turbulent times (period
   2009-2012). The data consists of log files, and web mining techniques
   were applied (the modelling of web user behaviour in dependence on time
   - based on the proposals of the authors). The results show that also in
   turbulent times, stakeholders' interest in Pillar 3 disclosures is low
   (in line with (Munk, Pilkova, Benko, & Blazekova, 2017)) and the highest
   interest was identified for the Pricing List category. After turbulent
   times, Pillar 3 categories (Pillar 3 related information and Pillar 3
   disclosures) have weak interest, with peaks at the beginning of the
   year, and the highest increase was in the Business Conditions category.
   The results suggest that the enhancement of interest of key stakeholders
   in disclosures inevitably requires changes to deliver sufficient
   disclosure data structures and to design a disclosure policy that
   fulfils regulatory expectations.

AB With the increasing amount of web pages over the internet, it has been a
   major concern to obtain information on the internet with accuracy at
   reasonable cost and feasible performance. A potential solution would be
   through web page classification. An effective classification of web
   pages is of benefit in various applications such as web mining and
   search engines. Unlike text documents, the nature of web pages limits
   the performance of successful traditional pure-text classification
   methods. Existence of noises in the form of HTML tags, multimedia
   contents, dynamic contents and the network structure of web pages
   requires a deeper look into effective feature selection of web pages.
   Often, these features are filtered out relying on the displayed texts of
   the web page for classification. Instead in this research paper, web
   page features are taken into consideration during classification of the
   web page due to the potential valuable information that might be stored.
   For this reason, this paper explores the potential of the universal
   Resource Locator (URL), web page title as well as the metadata for
   classification into various categories defined by the users. The
   framework uses suitable machine learning algorithms for individual
   classification of these web features to jointly vote by weight towards
   the eventual classification of the webpage. This approach showed
   improvements over pure-text as well as virtual-webpage classification
   approaches.

AB The problem of growing computational complexity in the finance industry
   demands manageable, high-speed and real-time solutions in solving
   complex mathematical problems such as option pricing. In current option
   trading scenarios, determining a fair price for options "any time" and
   "anywhere" has become vital yet difficult computational problem. In this
   study, we have designed, implemented, and deployed an architecture for
   pricing options on-line using a hand-held device that is J2ME-based
   Mobile computing-enabled and is assisted by web mining tools. In our
   architecture, the client is a MIDP user interface, and the back end
   servlet runs on a standalone server bound to a known port address. In
   addition, the server uses table-mining techniques to mine real-time data
   from reliable web sources upon the mobile trader's directive. The server
   performs all computations required for pricing options since mobile
   devices have limited battery power, low bandwidth, and low memory. We
   have parallelized and implemented various computational techniques such
   as binomial lattice and finite differencing. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is one of the first studies that facilitate the
   mobile-enabled-trader to compute the price of an option in ubiquitous
   fashion. This architecture aims at providing the trader with various
   computational techniques to avail (to provide results from approximate
   to accurate results) while on-the-go and to make important and effective
   trading decisions using the results that will ensure higher returns on
   investments in options.

AB The field of lead user research has seen a great deal of attention from
   academics and practitioners alike. However, we still lack a full
   understanding of the nature of users with high potential for innovation.
   In this paper, we employ a social network perspective on lead users.
   Increasing the realism of our research in three empirical studies with
   different empirical settings and methods, we provide robust evidence
   that lead users have a distinctive social network position: They exhibit
   an unusually high level of betweenness centrality, meaning that they are
   positioned as bridges between different social groups. This finding has
   two major implications for lead user theory. First, it consolidates
   seminal conceptual work on lead users and their embeddedness in social
   networks. And second, the findings extend and validate prior work on the
   social network perspective of lead users by combining theoretical
   insights from cognitive psychology, research on creativity, and network
   theory. As the social network positions of individuals can be mapped
   quickly and at low cost with modern Web mining tools, our findings may
   point to a new and readily applicable approach for the efficient and
   effective identification of lead users in real-life projects, an aspect
   that is usually emphasized as the most crucial activity in lead user
   projects.

   In this paper, we propose the use of set of term stored in a database to
   categorize computer science papers. Few methods and algorithms from
   related work are considered in improving the categorization process. We
   have evaluated our document categorizer agent on a number of computer
   science papers. The categorization process is done by parsing the
   document, calculating the frequency of each term and matching the terms
   found with the dataset found in the database. We have shown that the use
   of this term database can be used to categorize documents. The
   categorizer agent focuses on categorizing the text document into
   predetermined category based on the extracted keyword This can help in

AB The different web mining methods and techniques can help to solve some
   typical issues of the contemporary websites, contribute to more
   effective personalization, improve a website structure and reorganize
   its web pages. However, only several papers tried to combine web
   structure and web usage mining (WUM) methods with this aim. The paper
   researches if and how the combination of selected web structure and WUM
   methods can identify misplaced web pages and how they can contribute to
   improving the website structure. The paper analyzes the relationship
   between the estimated importance of the web page from the web page
   creator's point of view using the web structure mining method based on
   PageRank and visitors' real perception of the importance of that
   individual web page using the WUM method based on sequence patterns
   analysis, which eliminates the problem with repeated visits of the same
   web page during one session. The results prove that the expected
   probability of accesses to the individual web page correlates with the
   observed visit rate obtained from the log files using the WUM method.
   Furthermore, the website can be improved based on the consequent
   application of the residual analysis on the obtained results. The
   applicability of the proposed combination of the web structure and WUM
   methods is presented on two case studies from different application
   domains of the contemporary web. As a result, the web pages, which are
   underestimated or overestimated by the web page creators, are
   successfully identified in both cases.

AB On-line behavioural targeting is a dynamically evolving area of web
   mining concerning the applications of data analysis of on-line users'
   behaviour and machine learning in optimising web on-line advertising and
   constitutes a problem of high importance and complexity.
   The paper reports on experimental work concerning testing various
   benchmark machine-learning algorithms and attribute preprocessing
   techniques in the context of behavioural targeting.
   Our final goal is to build a system which automatically learns and
   subsequently decides which on-fine advertisements to present to a user
   visiting a web page, based on his previous recorded behaviour, in order
   to maximise the revenue of the ad-network and the web site hosting the
   ad, and, at the same time, to minimise the user's annoyance caused by
   potentially inappropriate advertisements.
   We present a general adaptive model which makes it possible to test
   various machine-learning algorithms in a plug-in mode and its
   implementation.
   We also report our experimental work concerning comparison of the
   performance of various machine-learning algorithms and data
   preprocessing techniques on a real dataset.
   The performance of our experiments is evaluated by some objective
   metrics such as the click-through rate (CTR) or related.
   Our experimental results clearly indicate that the presented adaptive
   system can significantly increase the CTR. metric by 40% for some
   settings.
   All the experiments are performed on a real industrial dataset
   concerning on-line ads emitted in the Polish Web during a 1-month period
   in 2007.
   Up to the authors' best knowledge this is the first and largest
   evaluation made on this kind of real industrial data in Poland, at the
   time of writing.

   focus on the analysis of futures market price linkage model based on web
   news media. Firstly, we define the media factor in three-dimensional
   vector, including news number index, news length index and pessimism
   index, and find that it has great impact on information transmission
   mechanism between COMEX and SHFE, through guiding investor future
   sentiment. We further find that the pessimistic emotion impact on
   investors more strongly, which consistent with theoretical of noise
   traders. Secondly, the media factor embodied by the U.S media has
   greater influence on SHFE than COMEX. However, Chinese media does not
   have an extensive influence around the world, but its influences on
   trading volume and returns in SHFE are significant. Finally, we found
   that the gold futures returns in COMEX have a certain influence on
   Chinese media factor.

AB The weak signal concept according to Ansoff has the aim to advance
   strategic early warning. It enables to predict the appearance of events
   in advance that are relevant for an organization. An example is to
   predict the appearance of a new and relevant technology for a research
   organization. Existing approaches detect weak signals based on an
   environmental scanning procedure that considers textual information from
   the internet. This is because about 80% of all data in the internet are
   textual information. The texts are processed by a specific clustering
   approach where clusters that represent weak signals are identified. In
   contrast to these related approaches, we propose a new methodology that
   investigates a sequence of clusters measured at successive points in
   time. This enables to trace the development of weak signals over time
   and thus, it enables to identify relevant weak signal developments for
   organization's decision making in strategic early warning environment.

AB Internet technology enables companies to capture new customers, track

   interactions for electronic customer relationship management (e-CRM) can
   be performed by data-mining (DM), optimization methods, or combined
   approaches. Some of web mining techniques include analysis of user
   access patterns, web document clustering and classification. Most
   existing methods of classification are based on a model that assumes a
   fixed-size collection of keywords or key terms with predefined set of
   categories. We propose a new approach to obtain category-keyword sets
   with unknown number of categories. On the basis of the training set of
   Web documents, the approach is used to classify test documents into a
   set of initial categories. Finally evolutionary rules are applied to
   these new sets of keywords and training documents to update the
   category-keyword sets to realize dynamic document classification.

AB With an ever expanding content and user base, the Web presents
   information discovery and consumption challenges for both consumers and
   producers of information. Producers of information strive for visibility
   among consumers who have limited attention. Corporate websites are a
   primary digital marketing channel for firms through which they seek to
   gain a bigger share of their stakeholders' (i.e., customers, investors,
   communities) attention. Using observations spanning several years we
   study the website visibility, as measured by user traffic, of more than
   2500 public firms and its association with properties of corporate
   websites and the corresponding firms. One property that is of particular
   interest to us is the availability of "community-engaging" pages, i.e.,
   pages that support blogs or forums on the website or provide links to
   external social media platforms such as Facebook. These
   community-engaging pages signify online prosocial services provided by
   firms. We find that websites with larger number of community-engaging
   pages are associated with higher visibility. This provides a novel
   empirical support for the promotion and use of social media content and
   tools on websites of firms. We also find that websites with more
   specific content are associated with lower visibility while providing
   more out-links is associated with higher visibility. We observe these
   results consistently over time. These associations are observed while
   controlling for the size of the firms, types of their industries, the
   magnitude of media attention and other firm-level heterogeneity.
   Finally, machine learning models derived from our empirical analysis
   provide strong predictive utility for out-of-sample data. (C) 2017

AB The World Wide Web (WWW) is the largest distributed information space
   and has grown to encompass diverse information resources. Although the
   web is growing exponentially, the individual's capacity to read and
   digest content is essentially fixed. The full economic potential of the
   web will not be realized unless enabling technologies are provided to
   facilitate access to web resources. Currently web personalization is the
   most promising approach to remedy this problem, and web mining,
   particularly web-usage mining, is considered a crucial component of any
   efficacious web-personalization system. In this paper, we describe a
   complete framework for web-usage mining to satisfy the challenging
   requirements of web-personalization applications. For online and
   anonymous web personalization to be effective, web usage mining must be
   accomplished in real time as accurately as possible. On the other hand,
   web-usage mining should allow a compromise between scalability and
   accuracy to be applicable to real-life websites with numerous visitors.
   Within our web-usage-mining framework, we introduce a distributed
   user-tracking approach for accurate, scalable, and implicit collection
   of the usage data. We also propose a new model, the feature-matrices
   (FM) model, to discover and interpret users' access patterns. With FM,
   various spatial and temporal features of usage data can be captured with
   flexible precision so that we can trade off accuracy for scalability
   based on the specific application requirements. Moreover, tunable
   complexity of the FM model allows real-time and adaptive access pattern
   discovery from usage data. We define a novel similarity measure based on
   FM that is specifically designed for accurate classification of partial
   navigation patterns in real time. Our extensive experiments with both
   synthetic and real data verify correctness and efficacy of our
   web-usage-mining framework for anonymous and efficient web
   personalization.

AB We investigate the impact of idea mining filtering on web-based weak
   signal detection to improve strategic decision making. Existing
   approaches for identifying weak signals in strategic decision making use
   environmental scanning procedures based on standard filtering
   algorithms. These algorithms discard patterns with low information
   content; however, they are not able to discard patterns with low
   relevance to a given strategic problem. Idea mining is proposed as an
   algorithm that identifies relevant textual patterns from documents or
   websites to solve a given (strategic) problem. Thus, it enables to
   estimate patterns' relevance to the given strategic problem. The
   provided new methodology that combines weak signal analysis and idea
   mining is in contrast to existing methodologies. In a case study, a
   web-based scanning procedure is implemented to identify textual internet
   data in the field of self-sufficient energy supply. Idea mining is
   applied for filtering and weak signals are identified based on the
   proposed approach. The proposed approach is compared to a further -
   already evaluated - approach processed without using idea mining. The
   results show that idea mining filtering improves quality of weak signal
   analysis. This supports decision makers by providing early and
   suggestive signals of potentially emerging trends, even with only little
   expressive strength. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper shows the possibility of conducting a study of the regional
   economy based on alternative sources of official statistics. Official
   statistical resources in selected studies cannot be used or do not meet
   the requirements of relevance, reliability, and completeness. As new
   data resources, live data on the Internet should be considered. Two
   approaches to obtaining data on economic processes from the Internet can
   be distinguished: through a specially created program interface of
   websites (API) and as a result of scanning the contents of web pages
   (web-mining). Based on the open dataset published by PJSC "Sberbank", a
   number of features of social and economic processes in the regions
   related to the formation and use of household incomes have been
   established. Methods of time series analysis, variance analysis,
   multidimensional classification and factor analysis are applied. As a
   result, the seasonality and rhythm of the time series of salary and the
   amount of pension are established; the reduction of differentiation of
   regions according to the incomes of the population was revealed, with
   their insignificant growth; It is shown that the income indicators of
   the population are not determinative in financial activity; for
   relatively "poor" regions is characterized by a savings strategy of the
   households, "rich" - credit strategy.

AB While K-Means algorithm usually gets local optimal solution, spectral
   clustering method can obtain satisfying clustering results through
   embedding the data points into a new space in which clusters are
   tighter. Since traditional spectral clustering method uses Gauss Kernel
   Function to compute the similarity between two points, the selection of
   scale parameter a is related with domain knowledge usually. This paper
   uses spectral method to cluster XML documents. To consider both element
   and structure of XML documents, this paper proposes to use path feature
   to represent XML document; to avoild the selection of scale parameter a,
   it also proposes to use Jaccard coefficient to compute the similarity
   between two XML documents. Experiment shows that using Jaccard
   coefficient to compute the similarity is effective, the clustering
   result is correct.

AB If we cannot store all edges in a graph stream, which edges should we
   store to estimate the triangle count accurately?
   Counting triangles (i.e., cycles of length three) is a fundamental graph
   problem with many applications in social network analysis, web mining,
   anomaly detection, etc. Recently, much effort has been made to
   accurately estimate global and local triangle counts in streaming
   settings with limited space. Although existing methods use sampling
   techniques without considering temporal dependencies in edges, we
   observe temporal locality in real dynamic graphs. That is, future edges
   are more likely to form triangles with recent edges than with older
   edges.
   In this work, we propose a single-pass streaming algorithm called
   Waiting-Room Sampling (WRS) for global and local triangle counting. WRS
   exploits the temporal locality by always storing the most recent edges,
   which future edges are more likely to form triangles with, in the
   waiting room, while it uses reservoir sampling for the remaining edges.
   Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that WRS is: (a) Fast and
   'any time': runs in linear time, always maintaining and updating
   estimates while new edges arrive, (b) Effective: yields up to 47%
   smaller estimation error than its best competitors, and (c)
   Theoretically sound: gives unbiased estimates with small variances under
   the temporal locality.

AB The customer acquisition process is generally a stressful undertaking
   for sales representatives. Luckily there are models that assist them in
   selecting the 'right' leads to pursue. Two factors play a role in this
   process: the probability of converting into a customer and the
   profitability once the lead is in fact a customer. This paper focuses on
   the latter. It makes two main contributions to the existing literature.
   Firstly, it investigates the predictive performance of two types of
   data: web data and commercially available data. The aim is to find out
   which of these two have the highest accuracy as input predictor for
   profitability and to research if they improve accuracy even more when
   combined. Secondly, the predictive performance of different data mining
   techniques is investigated. Results show that bagged decision trees are
   consistently higher in accuracy. Web data is better in predicting
   profitability than commercial data, but combining both is even better.
   The added value of commercial data is, although statistically
   significant, fairly limited. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the predictive power of online communities
   traffic in regard to stock prices. Using the largest dataset to date,
   spanning 8 years and almost the complete set of SP500 stocks, we analyze
   the predictive power of raw unstructured traffic without considering any
   sentiment associated. Our results partially challenge the assumption
   that raw traffic simply trails stock prices, as expected from a noisy
   signal without the sentiment direction. Raw traffic is shown to predict
   prices with statistical significance but with small economic impact.
   Anyway, this impact rises to moderate under the following conditions: 3
   to 7 days lag and stable traffic level. Moreover, the quality of the
   predictions significantly increases when a high level of traffic is
   coupled with low market volatility. The findings set interesting future
   works in the definition of novel indicators for market analysis based on
   web traffic features, to be coupled with complementary tools such as
   sentiment analysis.

AB E-commerce is a constantly growing and competitive market. Comparing
   product prices is an important task for online retailers as well as for
   e-shoppers. Online merchants compare their prices to those of their
   competitors for being able to adjust their prices on the market in order
   to remain competitive whereas the consumers want to find the best price
   for a specific product. Since internet prices are updated once a day or
   even more often and there is a huge number of product offers on the Web
   the product and price data need to be identified, collected and compared
   by an automated approach. This paper contributes a novel approach for
   the automated identification and extraction of product price data from
   arbitrary e-shop websites which is independent from the e-shops'
   language and the product domain. The adequacy of the proposed approach
   is demonstrated and evaluated through an experiment.

AB Web mining is one of the mining technologies, which applies data mining
   techniques in large amount of web data to improve the web services. Web
   traversal pattern mining discovers most of the users' access patterns
   from web logs. This information can provide the navigation suggestions
   for web users such that appropriate actions can be adopted. However, the
   web data will grow rapidly in the short time, and some of the web data
   may be antiquated. The user behaviors may be changed when the new web
   data is inserted into and the old web data is deleted from web logs.
   Therefore, we must re-discover the user behaviors from the updated web
   logs. However, it is very time-consuming to re-find the users' access
   patterns. Hence, many researchers pay attention to the incremental
   mining in recent years. The essence of incremental mining is that it
   utilizes the previous mining results and finds new patterns just from
   the inserted or deleted part of the web logs such that the mining time
   can be reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient incremental web
   traversal pattern mining algorithm. The experimental results show that
   our algorithm is more efficient than the other approaches.

AB A new battle in the knowledge sharing revolves around technologies for
   absorption, disambiguation and enrichment of entities from a variety of
   sources of structured and unstructured data. It is known then that there
   are for some time several technical approaches for integrating
   unstructured knowledge from diverse sources. Today's computers,
   increasingly fast, and the explosion of Web data and improved software
   techniques are opening the door to rapid progress. Scientists at
   universities, government labs, Google, Microsoft, IBM and elsewhere are
   pursuing breakthroughs together, even if they are on different paths. As
   recurrent difficulty in several studies there is an urgent need to solve
   the task of linking an entity mention in the text to the real world
   counterpart in the existing knowledge base (entity-linking). This task
   is challenging once ambiguity, textual inconsistency, and lack of
   knowledge of the world in the knowledge base are concerned. And although
   many methods have been proposed to overcome this problem with different
   approaches, it remains opened to the general context of unstructured
   knowledge sharing. Thus, the alternative proposed in this paper
   considers the construction of knowledge sharing in a limited scope. The
   research objective is sharing knowledge based on structured and
   unstructured knowledge from the ontology integrated with the automated
   and self-managed and in largescale extraction, also with the analysis of
   user interaction. The method is based in "Knowledge-Discovery in
   Databases" method for structured data and is intended to use "Ontology
   Web Language" as a formal language to deal with unstructured data,
   allied with user interactions. This work has been developed over the
   last two years, and this disclosure is intended to present preliminary
   results obtained from the use of tools for the automatic extraction and

   software helps users to instantiate ontology of book information on
   Amazon web site. This software also allows the user to merge another

   unit ontology. This software for integration of these ontologies uses a
   wide range of similarity measures, including semantic similarity,
   string-based similarity and structural similarity. The tree is used for
   investigating the structural similarity. Dictionaries like Wikipedia,
   WordNet, Google and Yahoo is used for investigating semantic similarity
   and string-based similarity.

AB Web usage mining is to analyze web log files to discover user accessing
   patterns of web pages. in order to effectively manage and report on a
   website, it is necessary to get feedback about activity on the web
   servers. The aim of this study is to help the web designer and web
   administrator to improve the impressiveness of a website by determining
   occurred link connections on the website. Therefore, web log files are
   pre-processed and then path analysis technique is used to investigate
   the URL information concerning access to electronic Sources. The
   proposed methodology is applied to the web log files in the web server
   of Firat University. The results and findings of this experimental study
   can be used by the web designer in order to plan the upgrading and

AB Online customer reviews offer valuable information for merchants and
   potential shoppers in e-Commerce and e-Business. However, even for a
   single product, the number of reviews often amounts to hundreds or
   thousands. Thus, summarization of multiple customer reviews is helpful
   to extract the important issues that merchants and customers are
   concerned with. Existing methods of multi-document summarization divide
   documents into non-overlapping clusters first and then summarize each
   cluster of documents individually with the assumption that each cluster
   discusses a single topic. When applied to summarize customer reviews, it
   is however difficult to determine the number of clusters a priori
   without the domain knowledge, and moreover, topics often overlap with
   each other in a collection of customer reviews. This paper proposes a
   summarization approach based on the topical structure of multiple
   customer reviews. Instead of clustering and summarization, our approach
   extracts topics from a collection of reviews and further ranks the
   topics based on their frequency. The summary is then generated according
   to the ranked topics. The evaluation results showed that our approach
   outperformed the baseline summarization systems, i.e. Copernic
   summarizer and clustering-summarization, in terms of users'
   responsiveness.

AB Information extraction (IE) is an important problem in Natural Language
   Processing (NLP) and Web Mining communities. Recently, IE has been
   applied to online sex advertisements with the goal of powering search
   and analytics systems that can help law enforcement investigate human
   trafficking (HT). Extracting key attributes such as names, phone numbers
   and addresses from online sex ads is extremely challenging, since such
   webpages contain boilerplate, obfuscation, and extraneous text in
   unusual language models. Assessing the quality of an IE system is an
   important problem that is particularly problematic in this domain due to
   lack of gold standard datasets. Furthermore, building a robust ground
   truth from scratch is an expensive and time-consuming task for social
   scientists and law enforcement to undertake. In this article, we
   undertake the empirical challenge of analyzing the quality of IE outputs
   in the HT domain without the provision of laboriously annotated ground
   truths. Specifically, we use concepts from network science to construct
   and study an extraction graph from IE outputs collected over a corpus of
   online sex ads. Our studies show that network metrics, which require no
   labeled ground truths, share interesting and consistent correlations
   with IE accuracy metrics (e.g., precision and recall) that do require
   ground-truths. Our methods can potentially be applied for comparing the
   quality of different IE systems in the HT domain without access to
   ground-truths.

AB The task of mining large unstructured text archives, extracting useful
   patterns and then organizing them into a knowledgebase has attained a
   great attention due to its vast array of immediate applications in
   business. Businesses thus demand new and efficient algorithms for
   leveraging potentially useful patterns from heterogeneous data sources
   that produce huge volumes of unstructured data. Due to the ability to
   bring out hidden themes from large text repositories, topic modeling
   algorithms attained significant attention in the recent past. This paper
   proposes an efficient and scalable method which is guided by topic
   modeling for extracting concepts and relationships from e-commerce
   product descriptions and organizing them into knowledgebase. Semantic
   graphs can be generated from such a knowledgebase on which meaning aware
   product discovery experience can be built for potential buyers.
   Extensive experiments using proposed unsupervised algorithms with
   e-commerce product descriptions collected from open web shows that our
   proposed method outperforms some of the existing methods of leveraging
   concepts and relationships so that efficient knowledgebase construction
   is possible.

AB The problem of obtaining relevant results in web searching has been
   tackled with several approaches. Although very effective techniques are
   currently used by the most popular search engines when no a priori
   knowledge on the user's desires beside the search keywords is available,
   in different settings it is conceivable to design search methods that
   operate on a thematic database of web pages that refer to a common body
   of knowledge or to specific sets of users. We have considered such
   premises to design and develop a search method that deploys data mining
   and optimization techniques to provide a more significant and restricted
   set of pages as the final result of a user search. We adopt a
   vectorization method based on search context and user profile to apply
   clustering techniques that are then refined by a specially designed
   genetic algorithm. In this paper we describe the method, its
   implementation, the algorithms applied, and discuss some experiments
   that has been run on test sets of web pages. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Purpose This study intends to examine consumers' fashion customization
   experiences through a web content mining (WCM) approach. By applying the
   theory of customer value, this study explores the benefits and costs of
   two levels of mass customization (MC) to identify the values derived
   from style (i.e. shoe customization) and fit customization experiences
   (i.e. apparel customization) and further to compare the dominating
   dimensions of value derived across style and fit customization.
   Design/methodology/approach A WCM approach was applied. Also, two case
   studies were conducted with one focusing on style customization and the
   other focusing on fit customization. The brand Vans was selected to
   examine style customization in study 1. The brand Sumissura was selected
   to examine fit customization in study 2. Consumers' comments on
   customization experiences from these two brands were collected through
   social networks, respectively. After data cleaning, 394 reviews for Vans
   and 510 reviews for Sumissura were included in the final data analysis.
   Co-occurrence plots, feature extraction and grouping were used for the
   data analysis. Findings The emotional value was found to be the major
   benefit for style customization, while the functional value was
   indicated as the major benefit for fit customization, followed by ease
   of use and emotional value. In addition, three major themes of costs,
   including unsatisfied service, disappointing product performance and
   financial risk, were revealed by excavating and evaluating consumers'
   feedback of their actual clothing customization experiences with
   Sumissura. Originality/value This study initiates the effort to use web
   mining, specifically, the WCM approach to thoroughly investigate the
   benefits and costs of MC through real consumers' feedback of two
   different types of fashion products. The analysis of this study also
   reflects the levels of customization: style and fit. It provides an
   in-depth text analysis of online MC consumers' feedback through the use
   of feature extraction analysis and word co-occurrence networks.

AB We investigate the issue of predicting new customers as profitable based
   on information about existing customers in a business-to-business
   environment. In particular, we show how latent semantic concepts from
   textual information of existing customers' websites can be used to
   uncover characteristics of websites of companies that will turn into
   profitable customers. Hence, the use of predictive analytics will help
   to identify new potential acquisition targets. Additionally, we show
   that a regression model based on these concepts is successful in the
   profitability prediction of new customers. In a case study, the
   acquisition process of a mail-order company is supported by creating a
   prioritized list of new customers generated by this approach. It is
   shown that the density of profitable customers in this list outperforms
   the density of profitable customers in traditional generated address
   lists (e.g. from list brokers). From a managerial point of view, this
   approach supports the identification of new business customers and helps
   to estimate the future profitability of these customers in a company.
   Consequently, the customer acquisition process can be targeted more
   effectively and efficiently. This leads to a competitive advantage for
   B2B companies and improves the acquisition process that is time- and
   cost-consuming with traditionally low conversion rates. (C) 2011

   site's structure, constructing and exploring the resulting webgraph,
   defining the correctness criterion, identifying control actions that
   would improve the structure under the given criterion, testing the
   correctness criterion on real-world examples and developing
   recommendations on improving the structure. PageRank is used as a
   criterion to evaluate the value of web pages. The value is determined by
   the presence/absence of a link pointing to that page from the homepage
   of the site. Going by the correctness criterion, valuable pages of a
   site should have the highest PageRank among all other pages of that
   site. Control action consists of removing non-valuable directories (and
   transforming them into independent sites), whose root page has a high
   PageRank. Experiments are conducted on three faculty sites of major
   universities in USA, Russia and Nigeria. The approach is shown to be
   applicable and reasonable in all cases.

   language processing and web mining. Due to the massive amount of users'
   reviews on the web about some entities or services, opinion mining is
   appeared to track users' emotions and feelings. Sentiment analysis is a
   synonym to opinion mining. Feature extraction is an important task in
   the sentiment analysis process. So, in this paper, a novel model is
   proposed to extract the most related features to a product from customer
   reviews using semantic similarity. Wordnet taxonomy and Stanford Part of
   Speech (POS) tagger are used in the feature extraction process. The
   extracted features are very important to generate a meaningful feature
   based product reviews summery which helps the customers to make a
   decision. The experiments are performed on three different datasets. The
   proposed model achieves promising results in terms of Precision, Recall
   and F-measure performance measures.

AB Customer journey analysis is a hot topic in marketing. Understanding how
   the customers behave is crucial and is considered as one of the key
   drivers of business success. To the best of our knowledge, a data-driven
   approach to analyze the customer journey is still missing. For instance,
   web analytics tools like Google Analytics provide an oversimplified
   version of the user behavior, focusing more on the frequency of page
   visits rather than discovering the process of the visit itself. On the
   other hand, customer journey maps have shown their usefulness, but they
   need to be created manually by domain experts. This paper contributes a
   novel approach for applying process mining techniques to web log
   customer journey analysis. Through process mining we are able to (i)
   discover the process that better describes the user behavior, (ii) find
   useful insights, (iii) compare the processes of different clusters of
   users, and then (iv) use this analysis to improve the journey by
   optimizing some KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) via personalized
   recommendations based on the user behavior. We show through a real-life
   case study a proof of the correctness of the introduced concept by
   improving the recommender accuracy when incorporating additional context
   information about the journey as extracted from the process model.

AB Currently, There are many E-commerce websites around the internet world.
   These E-commerce websites can be categorized into many types which one
   of them is C2C (Customer to Customer) websites such as eBay and Amazon.
   The main objective of C2C websites is an online market place that
   everyone can buy or sell anything at any time. Since, there are a lot of
   products in the E-commerce websites and each product are classified into
   its category by human. It is very hard to define their categories in
   automatic manner when the data is very large. In this paper, we propose
   the method for classifying E-commerce web pages based on their product
   types. Firstly, we apply the proposed automatic content extraction to
   extract the contents of E-commerce web pages. Then, we apply the
   automatic key word extraction to select words from these extracted
   contents for generating the feature vectors that represent the
   E-commerce web pages. Finally, we apply the machine learning technique
   for classifying the E-commerce web pages based on their product types.
   The experimental results signify that our proposed method can classify
   the E-commerce web pages in automatic fashion.

   technology, the web has become one of the most important means to obtain
   information for people. According to the web document classification and
   the theory of artificial neural network, a web classification mining
   method based on fuzzy neural network (FNN) is presented in this paper.
   We construct the structure of fuzzy neural network that used for web
   text information classification, and adopt the Levenberg-Marquart
   optimizing algorithm to train fuzzy neural network, thereby enhancing
   the convergence rate and the classification accuracy. The structure of
   web classification mining system based on fuzzy neural network is given.
   With the ability of strong self-learning and nonlinear function approach
   and pattern classification of fuzzy neural network, the classification
   mining method can truly classify the web text information. The actual
   classification results show that this method is feasible and effective.

   information contained in auction Web sites which are fast changing and
   highly dynamic. We develop a unified framework which can automatically
   extract product features and summarize hot item features from multiple
   auction sites. To deal with the irregularity in the layout format of Web
   pages and harness the uncertainty involved, we formulate the tasks of
   product feature extraction and hot item feature summarization as a
   single graph labeling problem using conditional random fields. One
   characteristic of this graphical model is that it can model the
   inter-dependence between neighbouring tokens in a Web page, tokens in
   different Web pages, as well as various information such as hot item
   features across different auction sites. We have conducted extensive
   experiments on several real-world auction Web sites to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our framework.

AB Living in a data driven world, the business news is very crucial for
   making economic decisions. To help decision makers obtain related
   business news quickly, two kinds of providers for business news, i.e.,
   the search engine (e.g., Google News) and business portals (e.g.,
   Reuters), are widely used. Though the keyword-based search engine is
   simple and easy to use, it has relatively low precision of the returned
   results and cannot directly provide news of particular business domains
   such as currency and real estate. In contrary, the portals can provide a
   variety of news of specific business domains, but it is difficult for
   users to browse since the front page looks so bloated and has many
   irrelevant ads. To solve the above problems, in this paper we propose
   and implement a platform named Intelligent Search Platform for Business
   News (ISPBN). This new platform not only combines the advantages of both
   search engine and portals, but also provides further analysis to
   discover the hidden relationships of different business news. To be
   specific, we incorporate automatic classification technology into the
   search platform to organize and retrieve business news in different
   domains. Furthermore, to fast guide users finding diversified and useful
   news, we construct a dynamic knowledge network graph to display the
   hidden relationships among news. Finally, we show the performance of our
   subsystems and present the final user interface of the proposed search
   platform.

AB Third-party Web tracking is a serious privacy issue. Advertisement sites
   and social networking sites stealthily collect users' Web browsing
   history for purposes such as targeted advertising or predicting trends.
   Unfortunately, very few Internet users realize this, and their privacy
   has been infringed upon because they have no means of recognizing the
   situation. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a
   system called MindYourPrivacy that visualizes third-party Web tracking
   and clarifies the entities threatening users' privacy. The
   implementation adopts deep packet inspection, DNS-SOA-record-based
   categorization, and HTTP-referred graphical analysis to visualize
   collectors of Web browsing histories without device dependency. To
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our proof-of-concept implementation, we
   conducted an experiment in an IT technology camp, where 129 attendees
   discussed IT technologies for four days, The experiment's results
   revealed that visualizing Web tracking effectively influences users'
   perception of privacy. Analysis of the user data we collected at the
   camp also revealed that MCODE clustering and some features derived from
   graph theory are useful for detecting advertising sites that potentially
   collect user information by Web tracking for their own purposes.

   nanotechnology and advanced materials firms. Indicators of four core
   concepts (R&D, IP protection, collaboration, and external financing) of
   the innovation process were built using keywords frequency analysis.
   These web-based indicators were validated using several indicators built
   from a classic questionnaire-based survey with the following methods:
   correlation analysis, multitraits multimethods (MTMM) matrices, and
   confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results suggest that formative
   indices built with the questionnaire and web-based indicators measure
   the same concept, which is not the case when considering the items from
   the questionnaire separately. Web-based indicators can act either as
   complements to direct measures or as substitutes for broader measures,
   notably the importance of R&D and the importance of IP protection, which
   are normally measured using conventional methods, such as government
   administrative data or questionnaire-based surveys.

AB Financial predictions, such as stock forecasts, is always one of the
   hottest topics for research studies and commercial applications. With
   the rapid growth of Internet technology in recent years, e-finance has
   become a vital application of e-commerce. However, in this "sea" of
   information, made available through the Internet, an "intelligent"
   financial web-mining and stock prediction system can be a key to
   success. In this paper, the author introduces the iJADE Stock Advisor-an
   intelligent agent-based stock prediction system using our proposed
   hybrid radial basis-function recurrent network (HRBFN). By using
   ten-year stock pricing information (1990-1999), consisting of 33 major
   Hong Kong stocks for testing, the iJADE Stock Advisor has achieved
   promising results in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and mobility as
   compared with other contemporary stock prediction models. Also, various
   analyzes on this stock advisory system have been performed: including
   round trip time (RTT) analysis, window-size evaluation test (for both
   long-term trend and short-term prediction), and stock prediction
   performance test.

AB Big dimensional data is a growing trend that is emerging in many real
   world contexts, extending from web mining, gene expression analysis,
   protein-protein interaction to high-frequency financial data. Nowadays,
   there is a growing consensus that the increasing dimensionality poses
   impeding effects on the performances of classifiers, which is termed as
   the "peaking phenomenon'' in the field of machine intelligence. To
   address the issue, dimensionality reduction is commonly employed as a
   preprocessing step on the Big dimensional data before building the
   classifiers. In this paper, we propose an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
   approach for large-scale data analytic. In contrast to existing
   approaches, we embed hidden nodes that are designed using singular value
   decomposition (SVD) into the classical ELM. These SVD nodes in the
   hidden layer are shown to capture the underlying characteristics of the
   Big dimensional data well, exhibiting excellent generalization
   performances. The drawback of using SVD on the entire dataset, however,
   is the high computational complexity involved. To address this, a fast
   divide and conquer approximation scheme is introduced to maintain
   computational tractability on high volume data. The resultant algorithm
   proposed is labeled here as Fast Singular Value
   Decomposition-Hidden-nodes based Extreme Learning Machine or FSVD-H-ELM
   in short. In FSVD-H-ELM, instead of identifying the SVD hidden nodes
   directly from the entire dataset, SVD hidden nodes are derived from
   multiple random subsets of data sampled from the original dataset.
   Comprehensive experiments and comparisons are conducted to assess the
   FSVD-H-ELM against other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results
   obtained demonstrated the superior generalization performance and
   efficiency of the FSVD-H-ELM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In any competitive business, success is based on the ability to make an
   item more appealing to customers than the competition. A number of
   questions arise in the context of this task: how do we formalize and
   quantify the competitiveness between two items? Who are the main
   competitors of a given item? What are the features of an item that most
   affect its competitiveness? Despite the impact and relevance of this
   problem to many domains, only a limited amount of work has been devoted
   toward an effective solution. In this paper, we present a formal
   definition of the competitiveness between two items, based on the market
   segments that they can both cover. Our evaluation of competitiveness
   utilizes customer reviews, an abundant source of information that is
   available in a wide range of domains. We present efficient methods for
   evaluating competitiveness in large review datasets and address the
   natural problem of finding the top-k competitors of a given item.
   Finally, we evaluate the quality of our results and the scalability of
   our approach using multiple datasets from different domains.

AB Models are predominantly developed using either quantitative data (e.g.,
   for structured equation models) or qualitative data obtained through
   questionnaires designed by researchers (e.g., for fuzzy cognitive maps).
   The wide availability of social media data and advances in natural
   language processing raise the possibility of developing models from
   qualitative data naturally produced by users. This is of particular
   interest for public health surveillance and policymaking, as social
   media provide the opinions of constituents. In this paper, we contrast a
   model produced by social media with one produced via expert reports. We
   use the same process to derive a model in each case, thus focusing our
   analysis on the impact of source selection. We found that three expert
   reports were sufficient to touch on more aspects of a complex problem
   (measured by the number of relationships) than several million tweets.
   Consequently, developing a model exclusively from social media may lead
   to oversimplifying a problem. This may be avoided by complementing
   social media with expert reports. Alternatively, future research should
   explore whether a much larger volume of tweets would be needed, which
   also calls for improvements in scalable methods to transform qualitative
   data into models.

AB One of the greatest and most recent challenges for online advertising is
   the use of adaptive personalization at the same time that the Internet
   continues to grow as a global market. Most existing solutions to online
   advertising placement are based on demographic targeting or on
   information gained directly from the user. The AdROSA system for
   automatic web banner personalization, which integrates web usage and
   content mining techniques to reduce user input and to respect users'
   privacy, is presented in the paper. Furthermore, certain advertising
   policies, important factors for both publishers and advertisers, are
   taken into consideration. The integration of all the relevant
   information is accomplished in one vector space to enable online and
   fully personalized advertising. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB The current growth and the technology used in global stock markets has
   created unprecedented opportunities for the individuals and businesses
   to access capital and grow and diversify their portfolios. Individuals
   nowadays can decide to invest and act in few minutes if not in few
   seconds. This growth has led to a corresponding growth in the amount of
   fraud and misconduct seen in the stock markets through the use of
   technology. The internet is often used as a real time platform for
   illegal financial activity such as illegal activities on Financial
   Discussion Boards (FDBs). Managing and monitoring FDBs in real time is a
   complex and time consuming task; given the volume of data produced and
   the fact that some of the data is unstructured. This paper presents a
   novel Financial Discussion Boards Irregularities Detection System
   (FDBs-IDS) for FDBs which can highlight irregularities or potentially
   unlawful practices on FDBs. For example comments that might suggest a
   pump and dump activity is happening. The proposed system extracts
   information from FDBs, where templates hosting scenarios of known
   illegal activities are used to detect any potential misdemeanors.
   Analysis conducted on a single day trading, found that of the 3000
   comments extracted from FDBs, 0.2% of these comments were deemed
   suspicious and required further investigation of a discussion board
   moderator. The manpower required to perform this task manually over the
   course of a year could be excessive and unaffordable. This research
   highlights the importance and the need of an automated crime detection
   system on FDBs, such as FDBs-IDS which could be used and thus tackle
   potential criminal activities on the internet.

AB This work studies how we can obtain feature-level ratings of the mobile
   products from the customer reviews and review votes to influence
   decision-making, both for new customers and manufacturers. Such a rating
   system gives a more comprehensive picture of the product than what a
   product-level rating system offers. While product-level ratings are too
   generic, feature-level ratings are particular; we exactly know what is
   good or bad about the product. There has always been a need to know
   which features fall short or are doing well according to the customer's
   perception. It keeps both the manufacturer and the customer
   well-informed in the decisions to make in improving the product and
   buying, respectively. Different customers are interested in different
   features. Thus, feature-level ratings can make buying decisions
   personalized. We analyze the customer reviews collected on an online
   shopping site (Amazon) about various mobile products and the review
   votes. Explicitly, we carry out a feature-focused sentiment analysis for
   this purpose. Eventually, our analysis yields ratings to 108 features
   for 4000+ mobiles sold online. It helps in decision-making on how to
   improve the product (from the manufacturer's perspective) and in making
   the personalized buying decisions (from the buyer's perspective) a
   possibility. Our analysis has applications in recommender systems,
   consumer research, and so on.

AB Even though expressive ontology representation languages like OWL have
   been proposed in the last years, most available ontologies only focus on
   taxonomical and, in a few cases, non-taxonomical knowledge. A way to add
   expressivity to an ontology is to include axioms that describe the basic
   logical properties of the modeled relationships. However, due to the
   manual knowledge acquisition bottleneck, axioms are usually missing in
   handcrafted ontologies. Moreover, automatic or semi-automatic ontology
   learning approaches aimed to acquire axioms from textual resources to
   enrich ontologies are scarce. This paper presents a novel methodology to
   learn axioms associated to non-taxonomic relationships modeled in an
   ontology in an automatic and unsupervised way, using the Web as corpus
   of textual resources. The proposed method is based on the use of
   specially tailored linguistic patterns, the exploitation of Web search
   engines as massive information retrieval tools, the application of
   shallow natural language processing and the assessment of semantic
   relatedness by means of Web-scale co-occurrence statistics. The paper
   describes the learning algorithm and presents promising results on the
   assessment of the following axioms: functional, inverse, symmetrical,
   transitive, reflexive and inverse functional properties. (C) 2011

AB The Set Partitioning Problem (SPP) aims to obtain non-empty disjoint
   subsets of objects such that their union equals the whole set of
   objects, and the partition meets some prespecified criteria. The
   ubiquity of SPP is impressive, given that it has a lot of theoretical
   and practical motivations. In the theoretical side, the study of the SPP
   is closely related to Bell numbers, Stirling numbers of the second kind,
   integer partitions, Eulerian numbers, Restricted Growth Strings (RGS),
   factoradic number system, power calculations, etc. In the practical
   side, SPP is intimately related to classification problems, clustering
   problems, reduction of dimensionality problems, and so on. In this work,
   three representations for instances of SPP are presented, these
   representations use: Restricted Growth Strings (RGS), factoradic number
   system, and a number system with a fixed base. Two cases for these
   representations will be presented: where the number of subsets is
   unbounded (i.e. the number of subsets can be the number of objects); and
   where the number of subsets is less than the number of objects.
   Bidirectional mappings between these three representations will be
   introduced, also the mapping among these three representations and the
   power of a base is defined. Given, that these three representations can
   be used to solve instances of SPP using exact, greedy, and metaheuristic
   algorithms, that require to do small changes to one possible solution
   and/or recombination of two possible solutions, definitions of mutation
   and recombination operators for the three representations will be shown.
   In order to motivate the use of the three representations for the
   solution of particular instances of SPP, it was decided to present their
   application to solve an instance of a set partition of integers problem
   (SPIP) using a simple genetic algorithm.

AB Online marketplaces often witness opinion spam in the form of reviews.
   People are often hired to target specific brands for promoting or
   impeding them by writing highly positive or negative reviews. This often
   is done collectively in groups. Although some previous studies attempted
   to identify and analyze such opinion spam groups, little has been
   explored to spot those groups who target a brand as a whole, instead of
   just products. In this article, we collected the reviews from the Amazon
   product review site and manually labeled a set of 923 candidate reviewer
   groups. The groups are extracted using frequent itemset mining over
   brand similarities such that users are clustered together if they have
   mutually reviewed (products of) a lot of brands. We hypothesize that the
   nature of the reviewer groups is dependent on eight features specific to
   a (group, brand) pair. We develop a feature-based supervised model to
   classify candidate groups as extremist entities. We run multiple
   classifiers for the task of classifying a group based on the reviews
   written by the users of that group to determine whether the group shows
   signs of extremity. A three-layer perceptron-based classifier turns out
   to be the best classifier. We further study behaviors of such groups in
   detail to understand the dynamics of brand-level opinion fraud better.
   These behaviors include consistency in ratings, review sentiment,
   verified purchase, review dates, and helpful votes received on reviews.
   Surprisingly, we observe that there are a lot of verified reviewers
   showing extreme sentiment, which, on further investigation, leads to
   ways to circumvent the existing mechanisms in place to prevent
   unofficial incentives on Amazon.

   addition, organizations now rely on social media for interacting
   internally as well as externally. Industries from manufacturing to
   retail to financial services, rely ever-more heavily on the use of
   social media causing an exploding Social Media Mining (SMM) applications

AB As the Web continues to grow, it has become increasingly difficult to
   search for relevant information using traditional search engines.
   Topic-specific search engines provide an alternative way to support
   efficient information retrieval on the Web by providing more precise and
   customized searching in various domains. However, developers of
   topic-specific search engines need to address two issues: how to locate
   relevant documents (URLs) on the Web and how to filter out irrelevant
   documents from a set of documents collected from the Web. This paper
   reports our research in addressing the second issue. We propose a
   machine-learning-based approach that combines Web content analysis and
   Web structure analysis. We represent each Web page by a set of
   content-based and link-based features, which can be used as the input
   for various machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach was
   implemented using both a feedforward/backpropagation neural network and
   a support vector machine. Two experiments were designed and conducted to
   compare the proposed Web-feature approach with two existing Web page
   filtering methods - a keyword-based approach and a lexicon-based
   approach. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach in
   general performed better than the benchmark approaches, especially when
   the number of training documents was small. The proposed approaches can
   be applied in topic-specific search engine development and other Web
   applications such as Web content management. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

AB User privacy on the internet is an important and unsolved problem. So
   far, no sufficient and comprehensive solution has been proposed that
   helps a user to protect his or her privacy while using the internet.
   Data are collected and assembled by numerous service providers.
   Solutions so far focused on the side of the service providers to store
   encrypted or transformed data that can be still used for analysis. This
   has a major flaw, as it relies on the service providers to do this. The
   user has no chance of actively protecting his or her privacy. In this
   work, we suggest a new approach, empowering the user to take advantage
   of the same tool the other side has, namely data mining to produce data
   which obfuscates the user's profile. We apply this approach to search
   engine queries and use feedback of the search engines in terms of
   personalized advertisements in an algorithm similar to reinforcement
   learning to generate new queries potentially confusing the search
   engine. We evaluated the approach using a real-world data set. While
   evaluation is hard, we achieve results that indicate that it is possible
   to influence the user's profile that the search engine generates. This
   shows that it is feasible to defend a user's privacy from a new and more
   practical perspective.

   E-commerce sites provide the independence to choose and buy things over

   products which could be bought with less. Although there are several
   e-commerce sites available in Bangladesh, no price comparison tool yet
   developed. Thus, we have designed and developed a price comparison tool
   for Bangladeshi websites named 'Upoma (Comparison)' which supports
   comparison even if the titles and prices of products are written
   English, Bangla, and Transliterated Bangla. We have fetched over
   90,53,015 product details from various websites to enrich our result
   based on the user's query. In order to make our system dynamic and to
   keep pace with real-time changes occurring on the sites, our database is

   other variants which allow to find an optimal architecture, but they
   tend to need a long time for training, especially in the case of complex

AB Different efforts have been done to address the problem of information
   overload on the Internet. Recommender systems aim at directing users
   through this information space, toward the resources that best meet
   their needs and interests by extracting knowledge from the previous
   users' interactions. In this paper. we propose three algorithms to solve
   the web page recommendation problem. In our first algorithm, we use
   distributed learning automata to learn the behavior of previous users'
   and recommend pages to the current user based on learned patterns. By
   introducing a novel weighted association rule mining algorithm, we
   present our second algorithm for recommendation purpose. Also, a novel
   method is proposed to pure the current session window. One of the
   challenging problems in recommendation systems is dealing with unvisited
   or newly added pages. By considering this problem and improving the
   efficiency of first two algorithms we present a hybrid algorithm based
   on distributed learning automata and proposed weighted association rule
   mining algorithm In the hybrid algorithm we employ the HITS algorithm to
   extend the recommendation set. Our experiments on real data set show
   that the hybrid algorithm performs better than the other algorithms we
   compared to and, at the same time, it is less complex than other
   proposed algorithms with respect to memory usage and computational cost
   too. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Web usage patterns from Web log files of a real Web site that has all
   the challenging aspects of real-life Web usage mining, including
   evolving user profiles and external data describing an ontology of the
   Web content. Even though the Web site under study is part of a nonprofit
   organization that does not "sell" any products, it was crucial to
   understand "who" the users were, "what" they looked at, and "how their
   interests changed with time," all of which are important questions in
   Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Hence, we present an approach
   for discovering and tracking evolving user profiles. We also describe
   how the discovered user profiles can be enriched with explicit
   information need that is inferred from search queries extracted from Web
   log data. Profiles are also enriched with other domain-specific
   information facets that give a panoramic view of the discovered mass
   usage modes. An objective validation strategy is also used to assess the
   quality of the mined profiles, in particular their adaptability in the
   face of evolving user behavior.

AB Users of online review sites can benefit from knowing the profiles of
   the businesses, as well as the profiles of reviewers who reviewed the
   businesses. This paper describes crisp and fuzzy metaclustering
   techniques to evolve two recursively defined clustering schemes of both
   businesses and reviewers in parallel using a real-world dataset supplied
   by yelp.com. The objective is to profile the businesses and reviewers by
   grouping them based on similar characteristics. The novelty of the
   proposed approach is in the fact that the representations of both
   businesses and reviewers change dynamically throughout the
   metaclustering process. A business is represented by static information
   obtained from the database and dynamic information obtained from the
   clustering of reviewers who reviewed the business. Similarly, the
   reviewer representation augments the static representation from the
   database with profiles of businesses who are reviewed by these
   reviewers. The resulting web-based service provides a facility for users
   to find similar businesses/reviewers based on the category of the
   business, rating, number of reviews, and number of check-ins. It also
   provides a succinct profile of a business or reviewer based on these
   factors so that the users can put the reviews in context. Since an
   object can belong to multiple clusters in fuzzy metaclustering, it is
   possible to absorb some of the extreme groups consisting of outliers in
   one of the mainstream clusters. As a result, the fuzzy metaclustering
   leads to more uniformly distributed and moderate profiles.

AB The Internet enables enterprises to sell their products via cross-border
   business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce portals. However, researchers know
   little about the early-mover advantages for such third-party platforms.
   The rapid, convenient, and wide market access offered by these platforms
   may allow early-mover exporters to enjoy advantages over late movers in
   terms of learning effects and switching costs. We hypothesize that
   early-mover advantages may diminish beyond a critical length of tenure
   because of the free-riding costs, resolution of technological or market
   uncertainty, as well as the incumbent inertia of early movers. We also
   argue that product price and diversity will pose different boundary
   conditions on how early-mover advantages are manifested. Using web
   search and mining methods, we collect data on approximately 300,000 B2B
   export transactions conducted by nearly 4000 firms in 2007-2014 through
   online portals. Employing panel data models, we find strong evidence
   supporting our hypotheses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The incredible increase in the amount of information on the World Wide
   Web has caused the birth of topic specific crawling of the Web. During a
   focused crawling process, an automatic Web page classification mechanism
   is needed to determine whether the page being considered is on the topic
   or not. In this study, a genetic algorithm (GA) based automatic Web page
   classification system which uses both HTML tags and terms belong to each
   tag as classification features and learns optimal classifier from the
   positive and negative Web pages in the training dataset is developed.
   Our system classifies Web pages by simply computing similarity between
   the learned classifier and the new Web pages. In the existing GA-based
   classifiers, only HTML tags or terms are used as features, however in
   this study both of them are taken together and optimal weights for the
   features are learned by our GA. It was found that, using both HTML tags
   and terms in each tag as separate features improves accuracy of
   classification, and the number of documents in the training dataset
   affects the accuracy such that if the number of negative documents is
   larger than the number of positive documents in the training dataset,
   the classification accuracy of our system increases up to 95% and
   becomes higher than the well known Naive Bayes and k nearest neighbor
   classifiers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   which assesses the maturity of technologies from the wireless industry,
   and the Technology Trend Tracker which measures hype versus reality for
   emerging technology trends such as cloud computing,
   software-as-a-service, and more. Finally, we discuss our experiences in
   using this platform to build these applications and the lessons learned.

AB While research on the Semantic Web has mostly focused on basic
   technologies that are needed to make the Semantic Web a reality, there
   has not been a lot of work aimed at showing the effectiveness and impact
   of the Semantic Web on business problems. This paper presents a case
   study where Web and Text mining techniques were used to add semantics to
   data that is stored in transactional databases of retailers. In many
   domains, semantic information is implicitly available and can be
   extracted automatically to improve data mining systems. This is a case
   study of a system that is trained to extract semantic features for
   apparel products and populate a knowledge base with these products and
   features. We show that semantic features of these items can be
   successfully extracted by applying text learning techniques to the
   descriptions obtained from websites of retailers. We also describe
   several applications of such a knowledge base of product semantics that
   we have built including recommender systems and competitive intelligence
   tools and provide evidence that our approach can successfully build a
   knowledge base with accurate facts which can then be used to create
   profiles of individual customers, groups of customers, or entire retail

   seeds of innovation in science and swiftly develop technological
   applications. Planners or managers of scientific and technological

   under circumstances of limited resources. Since the traditional
   expert-based approach is time-consuming and subjective, it is expected
   to be supplemented by a computer-based approach, including text, web and
   link mining, network analysis, link prediction and visualization. We
   developed a computer-based approach to comprehend science, technology,
   knowledge and market structures as well as detect trends for effective
   decision making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our tools by taking
   three different fields as examples. Even in the cases of complicated

AB Due to the language barrier, non-English users are unable to retrieve
   the most updated medical information from the U.S. authoritative medical
   websites, such as PubMed and MedlinePlus. However, currently, there is
   no any cross-language medical information retrieval (CLMIR) system that
   can help Chinese-speaking consumers cross the language barrier in
   finding useful English medical information. A few CLMIR systems utilize
   MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) to help overcome the language barrier.
   Unfortunately, the traditional Chinese version of MeSH is currently
   unavailable.
   In this paper, we employ a semi-automatic term translation method to
   construct a Chinese-English MeSH by exploiting abundant multilingual Web
   resources, including Web anchor texts and search-result pages. Through
   this method, we have developed a Chinese-English Mesh Compilation System
   to assist knowledge engineers in compiling a Chinese-English medical

   been used to develop a prototypical system for cross-language medical

AB Sitemaps designed by webmasters are not only presenting the main usage
   flows for users, but also organizing the hierarchical concept of the
   website. However, websites seldom provide sitemap pages to facilitate
   users to browse pages easily. Even provided, these sitemaps are not for
   machine-understanding, although few websites provide sitemaps with the
   XML format. In this paper, we develop a system, SiteMap Generator (SMG),
   to automatically generate the hierarchical sitemap for a website. SMG
   consists of five components. Sequence Translator translates a page's
   HTML source into a long sequence and then Page Partitioner splits the
   page into blocks based on analyzing the sequence complexity. Block
   Identifier categorizes each block into one of three block types:
   content, structure or redundant. Using the popular sequence searching
   tool, BLAST, Block Cluster calculates similarities between blocks so
   that blocks with similar functionalities are grouped and considered as
   candidate blocks for the sitemap. Finally, Hyper link Analyzer
   transforms page-to-page links into block-to-block links and applies
   Kleinberg's HITS algorithm to estimate authority and hub values of each
   block. Block entropy value derived from features entropies is also used
   to improve the HITS. Several experiments on three websites: Mozilla, CNN
   and Yahoo! News, show that SMG is useful to partition a page into blocks
   (F1 = 86%), identify the block type (F1 = 85%), and generate the sitemap
   for the website (F1 = 63%). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   to discover changes in selected portions of the original document.
   The proposed technique has been implemented in the CMW system providing

   detection of changes on selected portions of web documents and the
   possibility to express complex queries on the changed information. For

   kinds of documents: 1) data sparseness and 2) synonyms/homonyms. The
   former leads to the lack of shared words and contexts among documents
   while the latter are big linguistic obstacles in natural language
   processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The underlying idea of
   the framework is that common hidden topics discovered from large
   external data sets (universal data sets), when included, can make short
   documents less sparse and more topic-oriented. Furthermore, hidden
   topics from universal data sets help handle unseen data better. The
   proposed framework can also be applied for different natural languages
   and data domains. We carefully evaluated the framework by carrying out
   two experiments for two important online applications (Web search result
   classification and matching/ranking for contextual advertising) with
   large-scale universal data sets and we achieved significant results.

AB This paper proposes an event data extraction method that extracts
   business event data, such as coupons, tickets, sales campaigns, etc.,
   from a homepage or blog of shops and pushes them to users. Users no
   longer need to browse their favorite shops' homepage one by one. The
   method supports comprehensiveness and effectiveness for event data
   obtainment. This proposition works into two tasks: web page block
   segmentation and event data identification. The first task segments the
   web page into blocks. Each of the blocks includes information, such as
   title, notification, date, etc. relating to event information. Many
   related works suppose web page block segmentation based on specific
   tags, vision, function, etc. In this research, we propose a web page
   block segmentation method based on HTML document structure analysis. The
   second task is used to identity event data from segmented blocks. We
   propose a method to implement event data identification based on machine
   learning. We show the results of a verification experiment. Experimental
   data are from 96 shops located in two underground shopping streets
   UNIMALL and ESCA, at a train station in the city of Nagoya (Japan).
   Because the event data identification depends on the Japanese language,
   this method is available for all the Japanese home page.

AB Sentiment analysis plays a very important role in BI's (Business
   Intelligence) applications which has been evident in the recent market
   activities. Towards sentiment analysis for most of the popular websites
   like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter necessitate the review of the customers
   which are used as a feedback. It's play very important role for product
   review, Business intelligence as well as in decision making. The main
   problem that arises to the point of view of users/customers is that, it
   is practically in-feasible to read all those online reviews one by one,
   because some of the products might have tens of thousand reviews. In
   this paper, reviews are collected from the sources like Amazon,
   Flipkart, and then used a method to combine both NLP (Natural Language
   Processing) and machine learning approach. Word sense disambiguation is
   also considered for this study. An improvised lesk algorithms is used
   for removing noise in the data.
   Different types of data have different types of properties and therefore
   are suited to different techniques correspondingly. This problem is
   closely related to the large scale nature of social networks and the
   necessity to perform aggregation operations, which results in the form
   of Pie-Chart. Thus, we aggregate millions of reviews into more
   user-friendly format.

AB Scalability has become an increasingly important issue for data mining
   and knowledge discovery in this "big data" era. Random sampling can be
   used to tackle the problem of scalable learning. Adaptive sampling is
   superior to traditional batch sampling methods as adaptive sampling
   typically requires a much lower sample size and thus better efficiency
   while assuring guaranteed level of estimation accuracy and confidence.
   In recent works, a new adaptive sampling method was developed by the
   author and colleagues, which has then been applied to build an
   efficient, scalable boosting learning algorithm. New results are
   presented in this paper on theoretical analysis of the proposed sampling
   method. Specifically, for controlling absolute error, a bound is
   established on the probability that the new sampling method would stop
   too early. It is also shown that the criterion function for controlling
   relative error is in fact a convex function. A new variant of the
   sampling method is also presented. Empirical simulation results indicate
   that our methods, both the new variant and the original algorithm, often
   use significantly lower sample size (i.e., the number of sampled
   instances) while maintaining competitive accuracy and confidence when
   compared with batch sampling method. An empirical study is also reported
   here showing efficient classification of Web advertisements using a
   sampling-based ensemble learner.

AB Work on sentiment analysis has thus far been limited in the news article
   domain. This has mainly been caused by 1) news articles lacking a
   clearly defined target, 2) the difficulty in separating good and bad
   news from positive and negative sentiment, and 3) the seeming necessity
   of, and complexity in, relying on domain-specific interpretations and
   background knowledge. In this paper we propose, define, experiment with,
   and evaluate, four different feature categories, composed of 26 article
   features, for sentiment analysis. Using five different machine learning
   methods, we train sentiment classifiers of Norwegian financial internet
   news articles, and achieve classification precisions up to similar to
   71%. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art in other domains and
   close to the human baseline.
   Our experimentation with different feature subsets shows that the
   category relying on domain-specific sentiment lexica ('contextual'
   category), able to grasp the jargon and lingo used in Norwegian
   financial news, is of cardinal importance in classification - these
   features yield a precision increase of similar to 21% when added to the
   other feature categories. When comparing different machine learning
   classifiers, we find J48 classification trees to yield the highest
   performance, closely followed by Random Forests (RF), in line with
   recent studies, and in opposition to the antedated conception that
   Support Vector Machines (SVM) is superior in this domain.

AB The architecture of Blue Martini Software's e-commerce suite has
   supported data collection, data transformation, and data mining since
   its inception. With clickstreams being collected at the
   application-server layer, high-level events being logged, and data
   automatically transformed into a data warehouse using meta-data, common
   problems plaguing data mining using weblogs (e.g., sessionization and
   conflating multi-sourced data) were obviated, thus allowing us to
   concentrate on actual data mining goals. The paper briefly reviews the
   architecture and discusses many lessons learned over the last four years
   and the challenges that still need to be addressed. The lessons and
   challenges are presented across two dimensions: business-level vs.
   technical, and throughout the data mining lifecycle stages of data
   collection, data warehouse construction, business intelligence, and
   deployment. The lessons and challenges are also widely applicable to
   data mining domains outside retail e-commerce.

AB With the tremendous popularity of social networking sites in this era of
   Web 2.0, increasingly more users are contributing their comments and
   opinions about products, people, organizations, and many other entities.
   These online comments often have direct influence on consumers' buying
   decisions and the public's impressions of enterprises. As a result,
   enterprises have begun to explore the feasibility of using social
   networking sites as platforms to conduct targeted marking and enterprise
   reputation management for e-commerce and e-business. As indicated from
   recent marketing research, the joint influential power of a small group
   of active users could have considerable impact on a large number of
   consumers' buying decisions and the public's perception of the
   capabilities of enterprises. This paper illustrates a novel method that
   can effectively discover the most influential users from social
   networking sites (SNS). In particular, the general method of mining the
   influence network from SNS and the computational models of mathematical
   programming for discovering the user groups with max joint influential
   power are proposed. The empirical evaluation with real data extracted
   from social networking sites shows that the proposed method can
   effectively identify the most influential groups when compared to the
   benchmark methods. This study opens the door to effectively conducting
   targeted marketing and enterprise reputation management on social
   networking sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB For sales and marketing organizations within large enterprises,
   identifying and understanding new markets, customers and partners is a
   key challenge. Intel's Sales and Marketing Group (SMG) faces similar
   challenges while growing in new markets and domains and evolving its
   existing business. In today's complex technological and commercial
   landscape, there is need for intelligent automation supporting a
   tine-grained understanding of businesses in order to help SMG sift
   through millions of companies across many geographies and languages and
   identify relevant directions.
   We present a system developed in our company that mines millions of
   public business web pages, and extracts a faceted customer
   representation. We focus on two key customer aspects that are essential
   for finding relevant opportunities: industry segments (ranging from
   broad verticals such as healthcare, to more specific fields such as
   "video analytics") and functional roles (e.g., "manufacturer" or
   "retail").
   To address the challenge of labeled data collection, we enrich our data
   with external information gleaned from Wikipedia, and develop a
   semi-supervised multi-label, multi-lingual deep learning model that
   parses customer website texts and classifies them into their respective
   facets. Our system scans and indexes companies as part of a large-scale
   knowledge graph that currently holds tens of millions of connected
   entities with thousands being fetched, enriched and connected to the
   graph by the hour in real time, and also supports knowledge and insight
   discovery. In experiments conducted in our company, we arc able to
   significantly boost the performance of sales personnel in the task of
   discovering new customers and commercial partnership opportunities.

AB In the Internet, where millions of users are a click away from your
   site, being able to dynamically classify the workload in real time, and
   predict its short term behavior, is crucial for proper self-management
   and business efficiency. As workloads vary significantly according to
   current time of day, season, promotions and linking, it becomes
   impractical for some ecommerce sites to keep over-dimensioned
   infrastructures to accommodate the whole load. When server resources are
   exceeded, session-based admission control systems allow maintaining a
   high throughput in terms of properly finished sessions and QoS for a
   limited number of sessions; however, by denying access to excess users,
   the website looses potential customers.
   In the present study we describe the architecture of AUGURES, a system
   that learns to predict Web user's intentions for visiting the site as
   well its resource usage. Predictions are made from information known at
   the time of their first request and later from navigational clicks. For
   this purpose we use machine learning techniques and Markov-chain models.
   The system uses these predictions to automatically shape QoS for the
   most profitable sessions. predict short-term resource needs, and
   dynamically provision servers according to the expected revenue and the
   cost to serve it. We test the AUGURES prototype on access logs from a
   high-traffic, online travel agency, obtaining promising results. (C)

AB The fiercely competitive web-based electronic commerce (e-commerce)
   environment has made necessary the application of intelligent methods to
   gather and analyze information collected from consumer web sessions.
   Knowledge about user behavior and session goals can be discovered from
   the information gathered about user activities, as tracked by web
   clicks. Most current approaches to customer behavior analysis study the
   user session by examining each web page access. However, the abstraction
   of subsessions provides a more granular view of user activity. Here, we
   propose a method of increasing the granularity of the user session
   analysis by isolating useful subsessions within sessions. Each
   subsession represents a high-level user activity such as performing a
   purchase or searching for a particular type of information. Given a set
   of previously identified subsessions, we can determine at which point
   the user begins a preidentified subsession by tracking user clicks. With
   this information we can (1) optimize the user experience by precaching
   pages or (2) provide an adaptive user experience by presenting pages
   according to our estimation of the user's ultimate goal. To identify
   subsessions, we present an algorithm to compute frequent click paths
   from which subsessions then can be isolated. The algorithm functions by
   scanning all user sessions and extracting all frequent subpaths by using
   a distance function to determining subpath similarity. Each frequent
   subpath represents a subsession. An analysis of the pages represented by
   the subsession provides additional information about semantically
   related activities commonly performed by users. (C) 2004 Wiley

AB The increasing popularity of Web 2.0 has led to exponential growth of
   user-generated content in both volume and significance. One important
   type of user-generated content is the blog. Blogs encompass useful
   information (e.g., insightful product reviews and information-rich
   consumer communities) that could potentially be a gold mine for business
   intelligence, bringing great opportunities for both academic research
   and business applications. However, performing business intelligence on
   blogs is quite challenging because of the vast amount of information and
   the lack of commonly adopted methodology for effectively collecting and
   analyzing such information. In this paper, we propose a framework fir
   gathering business intelligence from blogs by automatically collecting
   and analyzing blog contents and bloggers' interaction networks. Through
   a system developed using the framework, we conducted two case studies
   with one case focusing on a consumer product and the other on a company.
   Our case studies demonstrate how to use the framework and appropriate
   techniques to effectively collect, extract, and analyze blogs related to
   the topics of interest, reveal novel patterns in the blogger
   interactions and communities, and answer important business intelligence
   questions in the domains. The framework is sufficiently generic and can
   be applied to any topics of interest, organizations, and products.
   Future academic research and business applications related to the topics
   examined in the two cases can also be built using the findings of this
   study.

   Twitter users, based on their tweets and community relationships. Many
   people post their opinions via social media services such as Twitter.
   This huge volume of opinions, expressed in real time, has great appeal
   as a novel marketing application. When automatically extracting these
   opinions, it is desirable to be able to discriminate discrimination
   based on user demographics, because the ratio of positive and negative
   opinions differs depending on demographics such as age, gender, and
   residence area, all of which are essential for market analysis. In this
   paper, we propose a hybrid text-based and community-based method for the
   demographic estimation of Twitter users, where these demographics are
   estimated by tracking the tweet history and clustering of
   followers/followees. Our experimental results from 100,000 Twitter users
   show that the proposed hybrid method improves the accuracy of the
   text-based method. The proposed method is applicable to various user
   demographics and is suitable even for users who only tweet infrequently.

AB Based on the assumption that users generally have a tendency to use

   to research conducted on the emerging field of trust-based recommender
   system. We propose to integrate the temporal factor in measuring trust
   between social network friends. A Trusted Friend's calculation method is
   developed for determining social trusted friends in Facebook. We have,
   accordingly, demonstrated the importance of the interactions' time
   between users. Afterwards, we have used this method in a semantic
   tourism recommender system as a smart etourism tool able to recommend
   items based on the users' preferences and their trusted friends'
   preferences. We have also applied our tourism recommender system for the
   case of medical tourism in Tunisia to help users interested in traveling
   to Tunisia for medical purposes. Finally, we have implemented the system
   and collected feedback from real users to evaluate the quality of
   recommendation and prove its importance in improving the medical tourism

AB Lately, recommender systems (RS) have offered a remarkable breakthrough
   to users. It lessens the user time cost thereby delivering faster and
   better results. After purchasing a product there are recommendations
   according to the different comments provided by users. Within a short
   span of product utilization and quality, the users receive a product
   recommendation. But this doesn't work out good so as to make it much
   better; feedbacks, commands and reviews are fetched on the basis of
   in-depth commands, globally like and normal keys. Recommendation systems
   are crucially important for the delivery of personalized product to
   users. With personalized recommendation to product, users can enjoy a
   variety of targeted recommendations such as online product; the current
   paper suggests hybrid recommendation system (HRS) that makes use of
   rating and review to recommend any product to user. The main objective
   of this paper is to personalize recommendation of product that have
   become extremely effective revenue drivers for online shopping business.
   Despite the great benefits, deploying personalized recommendation
   services typically requires the collection of users' personal data for
   processing and analytics, which undesirably makes users. To implement
   product recommendations following are incorporated that is retrieving
   personal data, Logical Language based Rule Generation (LLRG), ranking
   and Hybrid recommendation system. The stages in the suggested
   recommendation system include, Data Gathering, preprocessing, filtering
   and Ranking. The Ranking algorithm ranks the products in relation to the
   sales count. The top list displays the product having greatest count
   number. In the LLRG strategy, the logic rule generation methodology
   retrieves useful and mandatory data from reviews, commands, products
   original state and thereafter comes the recommendation. The HRS enforces
   two techniques, namely, location based and the other being heterogeneous
   domain based. Also the recommendations presented to the user are in
   context to the user's activities, choices and conduct that are in accord
   with user's personal likings and aids in decision making. When comparing
   the outcome, it is clear that the suggested method is superior than the
   traditional with regard to clarity, effective recommendation and
   coverage rate. It's evaluated that Hybrid Recommendation System yields
   in greater results compared with rest of the existing recommendation
   techniques. We, also identity to some future research directions.
